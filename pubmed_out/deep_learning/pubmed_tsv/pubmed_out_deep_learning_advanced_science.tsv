Adv Sci (Weinh)	2021	Adv Sci (Weinh). 2020 Dec 21;8(3):2003097. doi: 10.1002/advs.202003097. eCollection 2021 Feb.	Optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is an excellent modality for in vivo biomedical imaging as it noninvasively provides high-resolution morphologic and functional information without the need for exogenous contrast agents. However, the high excitation laser dosage, limited imaging speed, and imperfect image quality still hinder the use of OR-PAM in clinical applications. The laser dosage, imaging speed, and image quality are mutually restrained by each other, and thus far, no methods have been proposed to resolve this challenge. Here, a deep learning method called the multitask residual dense network is proposed to overcome this challenge. This method utilizes an innovative strategy of integrating multisupervised learning, dual-channel sample collection, and a reasonable weight distribution. The proposed deep learning method is combined with an application-targeted modified OR-PAM system. Superior images under ultralow laser dosage (32-fold reduced dosage) are obtained for the first time in this study. Using this new technique, a high-quality, high-speed OR-PAM system that meets clinical requirements is now conceivable.	deep learning; multitask residual dense networks; optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy; ultralow laser dosage	20201221	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33552869

Adv Sci (Weinh)	2020	Adv Sci (Weinh). 2020 Nov 17;8(1):2002886. doi: 10.1002/advs.202002886. eCollection 2020 Jan.	A nonintrusive far-field optical microscopy resolving structures at the nanometer scale would revolutionize biomedicine and nanotechnology but is not yet available. Here, a new type of microscopy is introduced, which reveals the fine structure of an object through its far-field scattering pattern under illumination with light containing deeply subwavelength singularity features. The object is reconstructed by a neural network trained on a large number of scattering events. In numerical experiments on imaging of a dimer, resolving powers better than lambda/200, i.e., two orders of magnitude beyond the conventional "diffraction limit" of lambda/2, are demonstrated. It is shown that imaging is tolerant to noise and is achievable with low dynamic range light intensity detectors. Proof-of-principle experimental confirmation of DSTM is provided with a training set of small size, yet sufficient to achieve resolution five-fold better than the diffraction limit. In principle, deep learning reconstruction can be extended to objects of random shape and shall be particularly efficient in microscopy of a priori known shapes, such as those found in routine tasks of machine vision, smart manufacturing, and particle counting for life sciences applications.	machine learning; microscopy; superoscillations; superresolution; unlabeled	20201117	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33437583

Adv Sci (Weinh)	2020	Adv Sci (Weinh). 2020 Sep 23;7(21):2002021. doi: 10.1002/advs.202002021. eCollection 2020 Nov.	Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, expected to result in 61 million disability-adjusted life-years in 2020. Rapid diagnostics is the core of stroke management for early prevention and medical treatment. Serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) reflect underlying disease progression, predictive of patient phenotypes. Deep learning (DL) encoding SMFs with clinical indexes outperforms single biomarkers, while posing challenges with poor prediction to interpret by feature selection. Herein, rapid computer-aided diagnosis of stroke is performed using SMF based multi-modal recognition by DL, to combine adaptive machine learning with a novel feature selection approach. SMFs are extracted by nano-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI MS), consuming 100 nL of serum in seconds. A multi-modal recognition is constructed by integrating SMFs and clinical indexes with an enhanced area under curve (AUC) up to 0.845 for stroke screening, compared to single-modal diagnosis by only SMFs or clinical indexes. The prediction of DL is addressed by selecting 20 key metabolite features with differential regulation through a saliency map approach, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms in stroke. The approach highlights the emerging role of DL in precision medicine and suggests an expanding utility for computational analysis of SMFs in stroke screening.	deep learning; diagnostics; mass spectrometry; metabolic fingerprints; stroke	20200923	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33173737
Ding, Wenze; Gong, Haipeng	Predicting the Real-Valued Inter-Residue Distances for Proteins.	Adv Sci (Weinh)	2020	Adv Sci (Weinh). 2020 Aug 10;7(19):2001314. doi: 10.1002/advs.202001314. eCollection 2020 Oct.	Predicting protein structure from the amino acid sequence has been a challenge with theoretical and practical significance in biophysics. Despite the recent progresses elicited by improved inter-residue contact prediction, contact-based structure prediction has gradually reached the performance ceiling. New methods have been proposed to predict the inter-residue distance, but unanimously by simplifying the real-valued distance prediction into a multiclass classification problem. Here, a lightweight regression-based distance prediction method is shown, which adopts the generative adversarial network to capture the delicate geometric relationship between residue pairs and thus could predict the continuous, real-valued inter-residue distance rapidly and satisfactorily. The predicted residue distance map allows quick structure modeling by the CNS suite, and the constructed models approach the same level of quality as the other state-of-the-art protein structure prediction methods when tested on CASP13 targets. Moreover, this method can be used directly for the structure prediction of membrane proteins without transfer learning.	deep learning; generative adversarial networks; protein inter-residue distance; protein structure prediction; real-valued distance prediction	20200810	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33042750

Adv Sci (Weinh)	2020	Adv Sci (Weinh). 2020 Jun 9;7(14):2000675. doi: 10.1002/advs.202000675. eCollection 2020 Jul.	Precision medicine for Alzheimer's disease (AD) necessitates the development of personalized, reproducible, and neuroscientifically interpretable biomarkers, yet despite remarkable advances, few such biomarkers are available. Also, a comprehensive evaluation of the neurobiological basis and generalizability of the end-to-end machine learning system should be given the highest priority. For this reason, a deep learning model (3D attention network, 3DAN) that can simultaneously capture candidate imaging biomarkers with an attention mechanism module and advance the diagnosis of AD based on structural magnetic resonance imaging is proposed. The generalizability and reproducibility are evaluated using cross-validation on in-house, multicenter (n = 716), and public (n = 1116) databases with an accuracy up to 92%. Significant associations between the classification output and clinical characteristics of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a middle stage of dementia) groups provide solid neurobiological support for the 3DAN model. The effectiveness of the 3DAN model is further validated by its good performance in predicting the MCI subjects who progress to AD with an accuracy of 72%. Collectively, the findings highlight the potential for structural brain imaging to provide a generalizable, and neuroscientifically interpretable imaging biomarker that can support clinicians in the early diagnosis of AD.

Adv Sci (Weinh)	2020	Adv Sci (Weinh). 2020 Mar 17;7(9):1901519. doi: 10.1002/advs.201901519. eCollection 2020 May.	Clean surgical margins in breast-conserving surgery (BCS) are essential for preventing recurrence. Intraoperative pathologic diagnostic methods, such as frozen section analysis and imprint cytology, have been recognized as crucial tools in BCS. However, the complexity and time-consuming nature of these pathologic procedures still inhibit their broader applicability worldwide. To address this situation, two issues should be considered: 1) the development of nonpathologic intraoperative diagnosis methods that have better sensitivity, specificity, speed, and cost; and 2) the promotion of new imaging algorithms to standardize data for analyzing positive margins, as represented by artificial intelligence (AI), without the need for judgment by well-trained pathologists. Researchers have attempted to develop new methods or techniques; several have recently emerged for real-time intraoperative management of breast margins in live tissues. These methods include conventional imaging, spectroscopy, tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, microscopy, fluorescent probes, and multimodal imaging techniques. This work summarizes the traditional pathologic and newly developed techniques and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Taking into consideration the recent advances in analyzing pathologic data from breast cancer tissue with AI, the combined use of new technologies with AI algorithms is proposed, and future directions for real-time intraoperative margin assessment in BCS are discussed.	artificial intelligence algorithms; breast cancer; breast-conserving surgery; deep learning; imaging; intraoperative diagnosis	20200317	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32382473
Chen, Chun-Teh; Gu, Grace X	Generative Deep Neural Networks for Inverse Materials Design Using Backpropagation and Active Learning.	Adv Sci (Weinh)	2020	Adv Sci (Weinh). 2020 Jan 9;7(5):1902607. doi: 10.1002/advs.201902607. eCollection 2020 Mar.	In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques are seen to be promising tools to discover and design novel materials. However, the lack of robust inverse design approaches to identify promising candidate materials without exploring the entire design space causes a fundamental bottleneck. A general-purpose inverse design approach is presented using generative inverse design networks. This ML-based inverse design approach uses backpropagation to calculate the analytical gradients of an objective function with respect to design variables. This inverse design approach is capable of overcoming local minima traps by using backpropagation to provide rapid calculations of gradient information and running millions of optimizations with different initial values. Furthermore, an active learning strategy is adopted in the inverse design approach to improve the performance of candidate materials and reduce the amount of training data needed to do so. Compared to passive learning, the active learning strategy is capable of generating better designs and reducing the amount of training data by at least an order-of-magnitude in the case study on composite materials. The inverse design approach is compared with conventional gradient-based topology optimization and gradient-free genetic algorithms and the pros and cons of each method are discussed when applied to materials discovery and design problems.	composites; inverse problem; machine learning; materials design; optimization algorithms	20200109	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32154072

Adv Sci (Weinh)	2019	Adv Sci (Weinh). 2019 Jul 24;6(17):1900939. doi: 10.1002/advs.201900939. eCollection 2019 Sep 4.	Commercially available health monitors rely on rigid electronic housing coupled with aggressive adhesives and conductive gels, causing discomfort and inducing skin damage. Also, research-level skin-wearable devices, while excelling in some aspects, fall short as concept-only presentations due to the fundamental challenges of active wireless communication and integration as a single device platform. Here, an all-in-one, wireless, stretchable hybrid electronics with key capabilities for real-time physiological monitoring, automatic detection of signal abnormality via deep-learning, and a long-range wireless connectivity (up to 15 m) is introduced. The strategic integration of thin-film electronic layers with hyperelastic elastomers allows the overall device to adhere and deform naturally with the human body while maintaining the functionalities of the on-board electronics. The stretchable electrodes with optimized structures for intimate skin contact are capable of generating clinical-grade electrocardiograms and accurate analysis of heart and respiratory rates while the motion sensor assesses physical activities. Implementation of convolutional neural networks for real-time physiological classifications demonstrates the feasibility of multifaceted analysis with a high clinical relevance. Finally, in vivo demonstrations with animals and human subjects in various scenarios reveal the versatility of the device as both a health monitor and a viable research tool.	ambulatory cardiac monitoring; physiological signals; stretchable hybrid electronics; wearable electronics	20190724	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31508289

Adv Sci (Weinh)	2019	Adv Sci (Weinh). 2019 Apr 19;6(12):1900128. doi: 10.1002/advs.201900128. eCollection 2019 Jun 19.	Metasurfaces provide unprecedented routes to manipulations on electromagnetic waves, which can realize many exotic functionalities. Despite the rapid development of metasurfaces in recent years, the design process of metasurface is still time-consuming and computational resource-consuming. Moreover, it is quite complicated for layman users to design metasurfaces as plenty of specialized knowledge is required. In this work, a metasurface design method named REACTIVE is proposed on the basis of deep learning, as deep learning method has shown its natural advantages and superiorities in mining undefined rules automatically in many fields. REACTIVE is capable of calculating metasurface structure directly through a given design target; meanwhile, it also shows the advantage in making the design process automatic, more efficient, less time-consuming, and less computational resource-consuming. Besides, it asks for less professional knowledge, so that engineers are required only to pay attention to the design target. Herein, a triple-band absorber is designed using the REACTIVE method, where a deep learning model computes the metasurface structure automatically through inputting the desired absorption rate. The whole design process is achieved 200 times faster than the conventional one, which convincingly demonstrates the superiority of this design method. REACTIVE is an effective design tool for designers, especially for laymen users and engineers.	absorbers; autoencoders; deep learning; discrete cosine transform; metasurfaces	20190419	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31380164
Ghosh, Kunal; Stuke, Annika; Todorovic, Milica; Jorgensen, Peter Bjorn; Schmidt, Mikkel N; Vehtari, Aki; Rinke, Patrick	Deep Learning Spectroscopy: Neural Networks for Molecular Excitation Spectra.	Adv Sci (Weinh)	2019	Adv Sci (Weinh). 2019 Jan 29;6(9):1801367. doi: 10.1002/advs.201801367. eCollection 2019 May 3.	Deep learning methods for the prediction of molecular excitation spectra are presented. For the example of the electronic density of states of 132k organic molecules, three different neural network architectures: multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and deep tensor neural network (DTNN) are trained and assessed. The inputs for the neural networks are the coordinates and charges of the constituent atoms of each molecule. Already, the MLP is able to learn spectra, but the root mean square error (RMSE) is still as high as 0.3 eV. The learning quality improves significantly for the CNN (RMSE = 0.23 eV) and reaches its best performance for the DTNN (RMSE = 0.19 eV). Both CNN and DTNN capture even small nuances in the spectral shape. In a showcase application of this method, the structures of 10k previously unseen organic molecules are scanned and instant spectra predictions are obtained to identify molecules for potential applications.

Accuracy of current efficacy judgment methods for nanoformulated drug remains unstable due to the interference of nanocarriers. Herein, DeepScreen, a drug screening system utilizing convolutional neural network based on flow cytomerty single-cell images, is introduced. Compared to existing experimental approaches, the high-throughput system has superior precision, rapidity, and anti-interference, and is cost-cutting with high accuracy. First, it can resist most disturbances from manual factors of complicated evaluation progress. In addition, class activation maps generated from DeepScreen indicate that it may identify and locate the tiny variation from cell apoptosis and slight changes of cellular period caused by drug or even nanoformulated drug action at very early stages. More importantly, the excellent performance of assessment on two types of nanoformulations and fluorescent drug proves the fine generality and anti-interference of this novel system. All these privileged performances make DeepScreen a very smart and promising system for drug detection.	anti-interference; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; drug screening; nanocarriers	20180723	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30250814
