Small open reading frames (smORFs) and their encoded microproteins play central roles in microbes. However, there is a vast unexplored space of smORFs within human-associated microbes. A recent bioinformatic analysis used evolutionary conservation signals to enhance prediction of small protein families. To facilitate the annotation of specific smORFs, we introduce SmORFinder. This tool combines profile hidden Markov models of each smORF family and deep learning models that better generalize to smORF families not seen in the training set, resulting in predictions enriched for Ribo-seq translation signals. Feature importance analysis reveals that the deep learning models learn to identify Shine-Dalgarno sequences, deprioritize the wobble position in each codon, and group codon synonyms found in the codon table. A core-genome analysis of 26 bacterial species identifies several core smORFs of unknown function. We pre-compute smORF annotations for thousands of RefSeq isolate genomes and Human Microbiome Project metagenomes and provide these data through a public web portal.	deep learning; genome annotation; machine learning; microbiome; microproteins; small open reading frames	20201207	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33290720

Cell Host Microbe	2021	Cell Host Microbe. 2021 Jan 13;29(1):132-144.e3. doi: 10.1016/j.chom.2020.10.004. Epub 2020 Oct 28.	Glycans, the most diverse biopolymer, are shaped by evolutionary pressures stemming from host-microbe interactions. Here, we present machine learning and bioinformatics methods to leverage the evolutionary information present in glycans to gain insights into how pathogens and commensals interact with hosts. By using techniques from natural language processing, we develop deep-learning models for glycans that are trained on a curated dataset of 19,299 unique glycans and can be used to study and predict glycan functions. We show that these models can be utilized to predict glycan immunogenicity and the pathogenicity of bacterial strains, as well as investigate glycan-mediated immune evasion via molecular mimicry. We also develop glycan-alignment methods and use these to analyze virulence-determining glycan motifs in the capsular polysaccharides of bacterial pathogens. These resources enable one to identify and study glycan motifs involved in immunogenicity, pathogenicity, molecular mimicry, and immune evasion, expanding our understanding of host-microbe interactions.	bioinformatics; deep learning; glycans; glycobiology; host-microbe; machine learning	20201028	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33120114
