Sci Transl Med	2021	Sci Transl Med. 2021 Feb 17;13(581). pii: 13/581/eabb3652. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.abb3652.	A reported 96,480 people were diagnosed with melanoma in the United States in 2019, leading to 7230 reported deaths. Early-stage identification of suspicious pigmented lesions (SPLs) in primary care settings can lead to improved melanoma prognosis and a possible 20-fold reduction in treatment cost. Despite this clinical and economic value, efficient tools for SPL detection are mostly absent. To bridge this gap, we developed an SPL analysis system for wide-field images using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and applied it to a 38,283 dermatological dataset collected from 133 patients and publicly available images. These images were obtained from a variety of consumer-grade cameras (15,244 nondermoscopy) and classified by three board-certified dermatologists. Our system achieved more than 90.3% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 90 to 90.6) and 89.9% specificity (89.6 to 90.2%) in distinguishing SPLs from nonsuspicious lesions, skin, and complex backgrounds, avoiding the need for cumbersome individual lesion imaging. We also present a new method to extract intrapatient lesion saliency (ugly duckling criteria) on the basis of DCNN features from detected lesions. This saliency ranking was validated against three board-certified dermatologists using a set of 135 individual wide-field images from 68 dermatological patients not included in the DCNN training set, exhibiting 82.96% (67.88 to 88.26%) agreement with at least one of the top three lesions in the dermatological consensus ranking. This method could allow for rapid and accurate assessments of pigmented lesion suspiciousness within a primary care visit and could enable improved patient triaging, utilization of resources, and earlier treatment of melanoma.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33597262

Sci Transl Med	2021	Sci Transl Med. 2021 Jan 27;13(578). pii: 13/578/eaba4373. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aba4373.	Improved breast cancer risk models enable targeted screening strategies that achieve earlier detection and less screening harm than existing guidelines. To bring deep learning risk models to clinical practice, we need to further refine their accuracy, validate them across diverse populations, and demonstrate their potential to improve clinical workflows. We developed Mirai, a mammography-based deep learning model designed to predict risk at multiple timepoints, leverage potentially missing risk factor information, and produce predictions that are consistent across mammography machines. Mirai was trained on a large dataset from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the United States and tested on held-out test sets from MGH, Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) in Taiwan, obtaining C-indices of 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.80), 0.81 (0.79 to 0.82), and 0.79 (0.79 to 0.83), respectively. Mirai obtained significantly higher 5-year ROC AUCs than the Tyrer-Cuzick model ( P < 0.001) and prior deep learning models Hybrid DL ( P < 0.001) and Image-Only DL ( P < 0.001), trained on the same dataset. Mirai more accurately identified high-risk patients than prior methods across all datasets. On the MGH test set, 41.5% (34.4 to 48.5) of patients who would develop cancer within 5 years were identified as high risk, compared with 36.1% (29.1 to 42.9) by Hybrid DL ( P = 0.02) and 22.9% (15.9 to 29.6) by the Tyrer-Cuzick model ( P < 0.001).		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33504648

Sci Transl Med	2020	Sci Transl Med. 2020 Aug 19;12(557). pii: 12/557/eaaz3738. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaz3738.	The adaptive immune system recognizes tumor antigens at an early stage to eradicate cancer cells. This process is accompanied by systemic proliferation of the tumor antigen-specific T lymphocytes. While detection of asymptomatic early-stage cancers is challenging due to small tumor size and limited somatic alterations, tracking peripheral T cell repertoire changes may provide an attractive solution to cancer diagnosis. Here, we developed a deep learning method called DeepCAT to enable de novo prediction of cancer-associated T cell receptors (TCRs). We validated DeepCAT using cancer-specific or non-cancer TCRs obtained from multiple major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) multimer-sorting experiments and demonstrated its prediction power for TCRs specific to cancer antigens. We blindly applied DeepCAT to distinguish over 250 patients with cancer from over 600 healthy individuals using blood TCR sequences and observed high prediction accuracy, with area under the curve (AUC) >/= 0.95 for multiple early-stage cancers. This work sets the stage for using the peripheral blood TCR repertoire for noninvasive cancer detection.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32817363

Sci Transl Med	2018	Sci Transl Med. 2018 Nov 7;10(466). pii: 10/466/eaat4921. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aat4921.	Existing methods to improve detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have focused on genomic alterations but have rarely considered the biological properties of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA). We hypothesized that differences in fragment lengths of circulating DNA could be exploited to enhance sensitivity for detecting the presence of ctDNA and for noninvasive genomic analysis of cancer. We surveyed ctDNA fragment sizes in 344 plasma samples from 200 patients with cancer using low-pass whole-genome sequencing (0.4x). To establish the size distribution of mutant ctDNA, tumor-guided personalized deep sequencing was performed in 19 patients. We detected enrichment of ctDNA in fragment sizes between 90 and 150 bp and developed methods for in vitro and in silico size selection of these fragments. Selecting fragments between 90 and 150 bp improved detection of tumor DNA, with more than twofold median enrichment in >95% of cases and more than fourfold enrichment in >10% of cases. Analysis of size-selected cfDNA identified clinically actionable mutations and copy number alterations that were otherwise not detected. Identification of plasma samples from patients with advanced cancer was improved by predictive models integrating fragment length and copy number analysis of cfDNA, with area under the curve (AUC) >0.99 compared to AUC <0.80 without fragmentation features. Increased identification of cfDNA from patients with glioma, renal, and pancreatic cancer was achieved with AUC > 0.91 compared to AUC < 0.5 without fragmentation features. Fragment size analysis and selective sequencing of specific fragment sizes can boost ctDNA detection and could complement or provide an alternative to deeper sequencing of cfDNA.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30404863
