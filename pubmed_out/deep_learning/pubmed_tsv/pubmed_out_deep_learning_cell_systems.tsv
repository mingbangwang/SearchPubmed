Cell Syst	2021	Cell Syst. 2021 Feb 8. pii: S2405-4712(21)00037-5. doi: 10.1016/j.cels.2021.01.003.	The antibody immune response is essential for the survival of mammals. However, we still lack a systematic understanding of the antibody repertoire. Here, we developed a proteomic strategy to survey, at an unprecedented scale, the landscape of antigen-engaged, circulating camelid heavy-chain antibodies, whose minimal binding fragments are called VHH antibodies or nanobodies. The sensitivity and robustness of this approach were validated with three antigens spanning orders of magnitude in immune responses; thousands of distinct, high-affinity nanobody families were reliably identified and quantified. Using high-throughput structural modeling, cross-linking mass spectrometry, mutagenesis, and deep learning, we mapped and analyzed the epitopes of >100,000 antigen-nanobody complexes. Our results revealed a surprising diversity of ultrahigh-affinity camelid nanobodies for specific antigen binding on various dominant epitope clusters. Nanobodies utilize both shape and charge complementarity to enable highly selective antigen binding. Interestingly, we found that nanobody-antigen binding can mimic conserved intracellular protein-protein interactions.

Cell Syst	2021	Cell Syst. 2021 Jan 20;12(1):92-101.e8. doi: 10.1016/j.cels.2020.10.007. Epub 2020 Nov 18.	Machine learning can infer how protein sequence maps to function without requiring a detailed understanding of the underlying physical or biological mechanisms. It is challenging to apply existing supervised learning frameworks to large-scale experimental data generated by deep mutational scanning (DMS) and related methods. DMS data often contain high-dimensional and correlated sequence variables, experimental sampling error and bias, and the presence of missing data. Notably, most DMS data do not contain examples of negative sequences, making it challenging to directly estimate how sequence affects function. Here, we develop a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning framework to infer sequence-function relationships from large-scale DMS data. Our PU learning method displays excellent predictive performance across ten large-scale sequence-function datasets, representing proteins of different folds, functions, and library types. The estimated parameters pinpoint key residues that dictate protein structure and function. Finally, we apply our statistical sequence-function model to design highly stabilized enzymes.	deep mutational scanning; positive-unlabeled learning; protein engineering; protein sequence function relationships; statistical learning; supervised learning	20201118	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33212013

Protein structure and function is determined by the arrangement of the linear sequence of amino acids in 3D space. We show that a deep graph neural network, ProteinSolver, can precisely design sequences that fold into a predetermined shape by phrasing this challenge as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), akin to Sudoku puzzles. We trained ProteinSolver on over 70,000,000 real protein sequences corresponding to over 80,000 structures. We show that our method rapidly designs new protein sequences and benchmark them in silico using energy-based scores, molecular dynamics, and structure prediction methods. As a proof-of-principle validation, we use ProteinSolver to generate sequences that match the structure of serum albumin, then synthesize the top-scoring design and validate it in vitro using circular dichroism.

Engineering gene and protein sequences with defined functional properties is a major goal of synthetic biology. Deep neural network models, together with gradient ascent-style optimization, show promise for sequence design. The generated sequences can however get stuck in local minima and often have low diversity. Here, we develop deep exploration networks (DENs), a class of activation-maximizing generative models, which minimize the cost of a neural network fitness predictor by gradient descent. By penalizing any two generated patterns on the basis of a similarity metric, DENs explicitly maximize sequence diversity. To avoid drifting into low-confidence regions of the predictor, we incorporate variational autoencoders to maintain the likelihood ratio of generated sequences. Using DENs, we engineered polyadenylation signals with more than 10-fold higher selection odds than the best gradient ascent-generated patterns, identified splice regulatory sequences predicted to result in highly differential splicing between cell lines, and improved on state-of-the-art results for protein design tasks.	alternative polyadenylation; deep learning; differential splicing; generative adversarial network; generative neural network; genomics; protein design; proteomics; sequence design	20200625	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32711843
Bernstein, Nicholas J; Fong, Nicole L; Lam, Irene; Roy, Margaret A; Hendrickson, David G; Kelley, David R	Solo: Doublet Identification in Single-Cell RNA-Seq via Semi-Supervised Deep Learning.	Cell Syst	2020	Cell Syst. 2020 Jul 22;11(1):95-101.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.cels.2020.05.010. Epub 2020 Jun 26.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) measurements of gene expression enable an unprecedented high-resolution view into cellular state. However, current methods often result in two or more cells that share the same cell-identifying barcode; these "doublets" violate the fundamental premise of single-cell technology and can lead to incorrect inferences. Here, we describe Solo, a semi-supervised deep learning approach that identifies doublets with greater accuracy than existing methods. Solo embeds cells unsupervised using a variational autoencoder and then appends a feed-forward neural network layer to the encoder to form a supervised classifier. We train this classifier to distinguish simulated doublets from the observed data. Solo can be applied in combination with experimental doublet detection methods to further purify scRNA-seq data to true single cells. It is freely available from https://github.com/calico/solo.

Zeng, Haoyang; Gifford, David K	Quantification of Uncertainty in Peptide-MHC Binding Prediction Improves High-Affinity Peptide Selection for Therapeutic Design.	Cell Syst	2019	Cell Syst. 2019 Aug 28;9(2):159-166.e3. doi: 10.1016/j.cels.2019.05.004. Epub 2019 Jun 5.	The computational identification of peptides that can bind the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with high affinity is an essential step in developing personal immunotherapies and vaccines. We introduce PUFFIN, a deep residual network-based computational approach that quantifies uncertainty in peptide-MHC affinity prediction that arises from observational noise and the lack of relevant training examples. With PUFFIN's uncertainty metrics, we define binding likelihood, the probability a peptide binds to a given MHC allele at a specified affinity threshold. Compared to affinity point estimates, we find that binding likelihood correlates better with the observed affinity and reduces false positives in high-affinity peptide design. When applied to examine an existing peptide vaccine, PUFFIN identifies an alternative vaccine formulation with higher binding likelihood. PUFFIN is freely available for download at http://github.com/gifford-lab/PUFFIN.

Predicting protein structure from sequence is a central challenge of biochemistry. Co-evolution methods show promise, but an explicit sequence-to-structure map remains elusive. Advances in deep learning that replace complex, human-designed pipelines with differentiable models optimized end to end suggest the potential benefits of similarly reformulating structure prediction. Here, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable model for protein structure learning. The model couples local and global protein structure via geometric units that optimize global geometry without violating local covalent chemistry. We test our model using two challenging tasks: predicting novel folds without co-evolutionary data and predicting known folds without structural templates. In the first task, the model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, and in the second, it comes within 1-2 A; competing methods using co-evolution and experimental templates have been refined over many years, and it is likely that the differentiable approach has substantial room for further improvement, with applications ranging from drug discovery to protein design.	biophysics; co-evolution; deep learning; geometric deep learning; homology modeling; machine learning; protein design; protein folding; protein structure prediction; structural biology	20190417	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31005579

While genes are defined by sequence, in biological systems a protein's function is largely determined by its three-dimensional structure. Evolutionary information embedded within multiple sequence alignments provides a rich source of data for inferring structural constraints on macromolecules. Still, many proteins of interest lack sufficient numbers of related sequences, leading to noisy, error-prone residue-residue contact predictions. Here we introduce DeepContact, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach that discovers co-evolutionary motifs and leverages these patterns to enable accurate inference of contact probabilities, particularly when few related sequences are available. DeepContact significantly improves performance over previous methods, including in the CASP12 blind contact prediction task where we achieved top performance with another CNN-based approach. Moreover, our tool converts hard-to-interpret coupling scores into probabilities, moving the field toward a consistent metric to assess contact prediction across diverse proteins. Through substantially improving the precision-recall behavior of contact prediction, DeepContact suggests we are near a paradigm shift in template-free modeling for protein structure prediction.	co-evolution; contact prediction; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; evolutionary couplings; protein structure prediction; structure prediction	20171220	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29275173

Cell Syst	2017	Cell Syst. 2017 Sep 27;5(3):212-220.e6. doi: 10.1016/j.cels.2017.08.004.	Ribosome stalling is manifested by the local accumulation of ribosomes at specific codon positions of mRNAs. Here, we present ROSE, a deep learning framework to analyze high-throughput ribosome profiling data and estimate the probability of a ribosome stalling event occurring at each genomic location. Extensive validation tests on independent data demonstrated that ROSE possessed higher prediction accuracy than conventional prediction models, with an increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve by up to 18.4%. In addition, genome-wide statistical analyses showed that ROSE predictions can be well correlated with diverse putative regulatory factors of ribosome stalling. Moreover, the genome-wide ribosome stalling landscapes of both human and yeast computed by ROSE recovered the functional interplays between ribosome stalling and cotranslational events in protein biogenesis, including protein targeting by the signal recognition particles and protein secondary structure formation. Overall, our study provides a novel method to complement the ribosome profiling techniques and further decipher the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying translation elongation dynamics encoded in the mRNA sequence.	deep learning; protein biogenesis; ribosome profiling; ribosome stalling; translation elongation dynamics; translational regulation	?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28957655

Computational elucidation of membrane protein (MP) structures is challenging partially due to lack of sufficient solved structures for homology modeling. Here, we describe a high-throughput deep transfer learning method that first predicts MP contacts by learning from non-MPs and then predicts 3D structure models using the predicted contacts as distance restraints. Tested on 510 non-redundant MPs, our method has contact prediction accuracy at least 0.18 better than existing methods, predicts correct folds for 218 MPs, and generates 3D models with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) less than 4 and 5 A for 57 and 108 MPs, respectively. A rigorous blind test in the continuous automated model evaluation project shows that our method predicted high-resolution 3D models for two recent test MPs of 210 residues with RMSD approximately 2 A. We estimated that our method could predict correct folds for 1,345-1,871 reviewed human multi-pass MPs including a few hundred new folds, which shall facilitate the discovery of drugs targeting at MPs.	co-evolution analysis; deep learning; deep transfer learning; homology modeling; membrane protein contact prediction; membrane protein folding; multiple sequence alignment	?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28957654
