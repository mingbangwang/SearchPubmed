Brain	2020	Brain. 2020 Jul 1;143(7):2312-2324. doi: 10.1093/brain/awaa160.	Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach to constructing imaging signatures of normal brain ageing as well as of various neuropathological processes associated with brain diseases. In particular, MRI-derived brain age has been used as a comprehensive biomarker of brain health that can identify both advanced and resilient ageing individuals via deviations from typical brain ageing. Imaging signatures of various brain diseases, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, have also been identified using machine learning. Prior efforts to derive these indices have been hampered by the need for sophisticated and not easily reproducible processing steps, by insufficiently powered or diversified samples from which typical brain ageing trajectories were derived, and by limited reproducibility across populations and MRI scanners. Herein, we develop and test a sophisticated deep brain network (DeepBrainNet) using a large (n = 11 729) set of MRI scans from a highly diversified cohort spanning different studies, scanners, ages and geographic locations around the world. Tests using both cross-validation and a separate replication cohort of 2739 individuals indicate that DeepBrainNet obtains robust brain-age estimates from these diverse datasets without the need for specialized image data preparation and processing. Furthermore, we show evidence that moderately fit brain ageing models may provide brain age estimates that are most discriminant of individuals with pathologies. This is not unexpected as tightly-fitting brain age models naturally produce brain-age estimates that offer little information beyond age, and loosely fitting models may contain a lot of noise. Our results offer some experimental evidence against commonly pursued tightly-fitting models. We show that the moderately fitting brain age models obtain significantly higher differentiation compared to tightly-fitting models in two of the four disease groups tested. Critically, we demonstrate that leveraging DeepBrainNet, along with transfer learning, allows us to construct more accurate classifiers of several brain diseases, compared to directly training classifiers on patient versus healthy control datasets or using common imaging databases such as ImageNet. We, therefore, derive a domain-specific deep network likely to reduce the need for application-specific adaptation and tuning of generic deep learning networks. We made the DeepBrainNet model freely available to the community for MRI-based evaluation of brain health in the general population and over the lifespan.	brain age; deep learning; transfer learning	?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32591831

Brain	2020	Brain. 2020 Jun 1;143(6):1920-1933. doi: 10.1093/brain/awaa137.	Alzheimer's disease is the primary cause of dementia worldwide, with an increasing morbidity burden that may outstrip diagnosis and management capacity as the population ages. Current methods integrate patient history, neuropsychological testing and MRI to identify likely cases, yet effective practices remain variably applied and lacking in sensitivity and specificity. Here we report an interpretable deep learning strategy that delineates unique Alzheimer's disease signatures from multimodal inputs of MRI, age, gender, and Mini-Mental State Examination score. Our framework linked a fully convolutional network, which constructs high resolution maps of disease probability from local brain structure to a multilayer perceptron and generates precise, intuitive visualization of individual Alzheimer's disease risk en route to accurate diagnosis. The model was trained using clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (n = 417) and validated on three independent cohorts: the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) (n = 382), the Framingham Heart Study (n = 102), and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) (n = 582). Performance of the model that used the multimodal inputs was consistent across datasets, with mean area under curve values of 0.996, 0.974, 0.876 and 0.954 for the ADNI study, AIBL, Framingham Heart Study and NACC datasets, respectively. Moreover, our approach exceeded the diagnostic performance of a multi-institutional team of practicing neurologists (n = 11), and high-risk cerebral regions predicted by the model closely tracked post-mortem histopathological findings. This framework provides a clinically adaptable strategy for using routinely available imaging techniques such as MRI to generate nuanced neuroimaging signatures for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, as well as a generalizable approach for linking deep learning to pathophysiological processes in human disease.

Brain	2020	Brain. 2020 Feb 1;143(2):582-596. doi: 10.1093/brain/awz417.	Whilst exaggerated bursts of beta frequency band oscillatory synchronization in the subthalamic nucleus have been associated with motor impairment in Parkinson's disease, a plausible mechanism linking the two phenomena has been lacking. Here we test the hypothesis that increased synchronization denoted by beta bursting might compromise information coding capacity in basal ganglia networks. To this end we recorded local field potential activity in the subthalamic nucleus of 18 patients with Parkinson's disease as they executed cued upper and lower limb movements. We used the accuracy of local field potential-based classification of the limb to be moved on each trial as an index of the information held by the system with respect to intended action. Machine learning using the naive Bayes conditional probability model was used for classification. Local field potential dynamics allowed accurate prediction of intended movements well ahead of their execution, with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.80 +/- 0.04 before imperative cues when the demanded action was known ahead of time. The presence of bursts of local field potential activity in the alpha, and even more so, in the beta frequency band significantly compromised the prediction of the limb to be moved. We conclude that low frequency bursts, particularly those in the beta band, restrict the capacity of the basal ganglia system to encode physiologically relevant information about intended actions. The current findings are also important as they suggest that local subthalamic activity may potentially be decoded to enable effector selection, in addition to force control in restorative brain-machine interface applications.

Brain	2019	Brain. 2019 Oct 1;142(10):2930-2937. doi: 10.1093/brain/awz254.	Neuromodulation is a promising treatment modality for disorders of learning and memory, offering the possibility of precise alteration of disordered neural circuits. Studies to date have failed to identify an optimal target and stimulation paradigm. Six epilepsy patients with depth electrodes implanted for seizure localization participated in our study. We recorded local field potentials from implanted electrodes while subjects participated in an associative learning task requiring them to learn an association between presented images and a button press. Three subjects participated in stimulation sessions during which caudate or putamen stimulation was delivered for some images during feedback after correct responses. Caudate stimulation enhanced learning. Both caudate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex demonstrated a beta power increase during the feedback period of the learning task that was greater following correct than incorrect trials. In dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, this difference increased with learning and persisted beyond the end of the feedback period. Caudate stimulation was associated with increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex beta power following feedback. These findings suggest that temporally specific caudate stimulation is a promising neuromodulation strategy to improve learning in disorders of learning and memory.

Brain	2019	Brain. 2019 Aug 1;142(8):2198-2206. doi: 10.1093/brain/awz152.	The basal ganglia and cerebellum are implicated in both motor learning and Parkinson's disease. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease that leads to motor and non-motor effects by modulating specific neural pathways. Recently, a disynaptic projection from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to cerebellar hemispheres was discovered. To investigate the functional significance of this pathway in motor learning, short-term improvement in motor execution in 20 patients with Parkinson's disease on and off STN-DBS and 20 age-matched healthy controls was studied in a visuomotor task combined with whole-brain connectomics. Motor learning was impaired in Parkinson's disease off stimulation but was partially restored through DBS. Connectivity between active DBS contacts and a distributed network of brain regions correlated with improvement in motor learning. Region of interest analysis revealed connectivity from active contact to cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to hand movement as the strongest predictor for change in motor learning. Peak predictive voxels in the cerebellum localized to Crus II of lobule VII, which also showed higher STN than motor cortex connectivity, suggestive of a connection surpassing motor cortex. Our findings provide new insight into the circuit nature of Parkinson's disease and the distributed network effects of DBS in motor learning.	basal ganglia; connectomics; deep brain stimulation; lobule VII; network mapping	?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31169872

Brain	2019	Brain. 2019 Apr 1;142(4):978-991. doi: 10.1093/brain/awz022.	Stroke is a leading cause of cognitive impairment and dementia, but the mechanisms that underlie post-stroke cognitive decline are not well understood. Stroke produces profound local and systemic immune responses that engage all major innate and adaptive immune compartments. However, whether the systemic immune response to stroke contributes to long-term disability remains ill-defined. We used a single-cell mass cytometry approach to comprehensively and functionally characterize the systemic immune response to stroke in longitudinal blood samples from 24 patients over the course of 1 year and correlated the immune response with changes in cognitive functioning between 90 and 365 days post-stroke. Using elastic net regularized regression modelling, we identified key elements of a robust and prolonged systemic immune response to ischaemic stroke that occurs in three phases: an acute phase (Day 2) characterized by increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling responses in innate immune cell types, an intermediate phase (Day 5) characterized by increased cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signalling responses in adaptive immune cell types, and a late phase (Day 90) by persistent elevation of neutrophils, and immunoglobulin M+ (IgM+) B cells. By Day 365 there was no detectable difference between these samples and those from an age- and gender-matched patient cohort without stroke. When regressed against the change in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores between Days 90 and 365 after stroke, the acute inflammatory phase Elastic Net model correlated with post-stroke cognitive trajectories (r = -0.692, Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.039). The results demonstrate the utility of a deep immune profiling approach with mass cytometry for the identification of clinically relevant immune correlates of long-term cognitive trajectories.	cognitive outcomes; machine learning; mass cytometry; stroke; systemic immunology	?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30860258

Brain	2018	Brain. 2018 Apr 1;141(4):971-978. doi: 10.1093/brain/awx373.	Direct electrical stimulation of the human brain can elicit sensory and motor perceptions as well as recall of memories. Stimulating higher order association areas of the lateral temporal cortex in particular was reported to activate visual and auditory memory representations of past experiences (Penfield and Perot, 1963). We hypothesized that this effect could be used to modulate memory processing. Recent attempts at memory enhancement in the human brain have been focused on the hippocampus and other mesial temporal lobe structures, with a few reports of memory improvement in small studies of individual brain regions. Here, we investigated the effect of stimulation in four brain regions known to support declarative memory: hippocampus, parahippocampal neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal cortex. Intracranial electrode recordings with stimulation were used to assess verbal memory performance in a group of 22 patients (nine males). We show enhanced performance with electrical stimulation in the lateral temporal cortex (paired t-test, P = 0.0067), but not in the other brain regions tested. This selective enhancement was observed both on the group level, and for two of the four individual subjects stimulated in the temporal cortex. This study shows that electrical stimulation in specific brain areas can enhance verbal memory performance in humans.awx373media15704855796001.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29324988

Brain	2016	Brain. 2016 Apr;139(Pt 4):1164-79. doi: 10.1093/brain/aww008. Epub 2016 Feb 24.	White matter hyperintensities are associated with increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline. The current study investigates the relationship between white matter hyperintensities burden and patterns of brain atrophy associated with brain ageing and Alzheimer's disease in a large populatison-based sample (n = 2367) encompassing a wide age range (20-90 years), from the Study of Health in Pomerania. We quantified white matter hyperintensities using automated segmentation and summarized atrophy patterns using machine learning methods resulting in two indices: the SPARE-BA index (capturing age-related brain atrophy), and the SPARE-AD index (previously developed to capture patterns of atrophy found in patients with Alzheimer's disease). A characteristic pattern of age-related accumulation of white matter hyperintensities in both periventricular and deep white matter areas was found. Individuals with high white matter hyperintensities burden showed significantly (P < 0.0001) lower SPARE-BA and higher SPARE-AD values compared to those with low white matter hyperintensities burden, indicating that the former had more patterns of atrophy in brain regions typically affected by ageing and Alzheimer's disease dementia. To investigate a possibly causal role of white matter hyperintensities, structural equation modelling was used to quantify the effect of Framingham cardiovascular disease risk score and white matter hyperintensities burden on SPARE-BA, revealing a statistically significant (P < 0.0001) causal relationship between them. Structural equation modelling showed that the age effect on SPARE-BA was mediated by white matter hyperintensities and cardiovascular risk score each explaining 10.4% and 21.6% of the variance, respectively. The direct age effect explained 70.2% of the SPARE-BA variance. Only white matter hyperintensities significantly mediated the age effect on SPARE-AD explaining 32.8% of the variance. The direct age effect explained 66.0% of the SPARE-AD variance. Multivariable regression showed significant relationship between white matter hyperintensities volume and hypertension (P = 0.001), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.023), smoking (P = 0.002) and education level (P = 0.003). The only significant association with cognitive tests was with the immediate recall of the California verbal and learning memory test. No significant association was present with the APOE genotype. These results support the hypothesis that white matter hyperintensities contribute to patterns of brain atrophy found in beyond-normal brain ageing in the general population. White matter hyperintensities also contribute to brain atrophy patterns in regions related to Alzheimer's disease dementia, in agreement with their known additive role to the likelihood of dementia. Preventive strategies reducing the odds to develop cardiovascular disease and white matter hyperintensities could decrease the incidence or delay the onset of dementia.

Miller, Jonathan P; Sweet, Jennifer A; Bailey, Christopher M; Munyon, Charles N; Luders, Hans O; Fastenau, Philip S	Visual-spatial memory may be enhanced with theta burst deep brain stimulation of the fornix: a preliminary investigation with four cases.	Brain	2015	Brain. 2015 Jul;138(Pt 7):1833-42. doi: 10.1093/brain/awv095. Epub 2015 Apr 21.	Memory loss after brain injury can be a source of considerable morbidity, but there are presently few therapeutic options for restoring memory function. We have previously demonstrated that burst stimulation of the fornix is able to significantly improve memory in a rodent model of traumatic brain injury. The present study is a preliminary investigation with a small group of cases to explore whether theta burst stimulation of the fornix might improve memory in humans. Four individuals undergoing stereo-electroencephalography evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy were enrolled. All participants were implanted with an electrode into the proximal fornix and dorsal hippocampal commissure on the language dominant (n = 3) or language non-dominant (n = 1) side, and stimulation of this electrode reliably produced a diffuse evoked potential in the head and body of the ipsilateral hippocampus. Each participant underwent testing of verbal memory (Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test), visual-spatial memory (Medical College of Georgia Complex Figure Test), and visual confrontational naming (Boston Naming Test Short Form) once per day over at least two consecutive days using novel test forms each day. For 50% of the trials, the fornix electrode was continuously stimulated using a burst pattern (200 Hz in 100 ms trains, five trains per second, 100 micros, 7 mA) and was compared with sham stimulation. Participants and examiners were blinded to whether stimulation was active or not, and the order of stimulation was randomized. The small sample size precluded use of inferential statistics; therefore, data were analysed using descriptive statistics and graphic analysis. Burst stimulation of the fornix was not perceived by any of the participants but was associated with a robust reversible improvement in immediate and delayed performance on the Medical College of Georgia Complex Figure Test. There were no apparent differences on either Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test or Boston Naming Test. There was no apparent relationship between performance and side of stimulation (language dominant or non-dominant). There were no complications. Preliminary evidence in this small sample of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy suggests that theta burst stimulation of the fornix may be associated with improvement in visual-spatial memory.	deep brain stimulation; memory; theta burst stimulation	20150421	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26106097
Herrojo Ruiz, Maria; Rusconi, Marco; Brucke, Christof; Haynes, John-Dylan; Schonecker, Thomas; Kuhn, Andrea A	Encoding of sequence boundaries in the subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease.	Brain	2014	Brain. 2014 Oct;137(Pt 10):2715-30. doi: 10.1093/brain/awu191. Epub 2014 Jul 16.	Sequential behaviour is widespread not only in humans but also in animals, ranging in different degrees of complexity from locomotion to birdsong or music performance. The capacity to learn new motor sequences relies on the integrity of basal ganglia-cortical loops. In Parkinson's disease the execution of habitual action sequences as well as the acquisition of novel sequences is impaired partly due to a deficiency in being able to generate internal cues to trigger movement sequences. In addition, patients suffering from Parkinson's disease have difficulty initiating or terminating a self-paced sequence of actions. Direct recordings from the basal ganglia in these patients show an increased level of beta (14-30 Hz) band oscillatory activity associated with impairment in movement initiation. In this framework, the current study aims to evaluate in patients with Parkinson's disease the neuronal activity in the subthalamic nucleus related to the encoding of sequence boundaries during the explicit learning of sensorimotor sequences. We recorded local field potential activity from the subthalamic nucleus of 12 patients who underwent deep brain stimulation for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease, while the patients in their usual medicated state practiced sequences of finger movements on a digital piano with corresponding auditory feedback. Our results demonstrate that variability in performance during an early phase of sequence acquisition correlates across patients with changes in the pattern of subthalamic beta-band oscillations; specifically, an anticipatory suppression of beta-band activity at sequence boundaries is linked to better performance. By contrast, a more compromised performance is related to attenuation of beta-band activity before within-sequence elements. Moreover, multivariate pattern classification analysis reveals that differential information about boundaries and within-sequence elements can be decoded at least 100 ms before the keystroke from the amplitude of oscillations of subthalamic nucleus activity across different frequency bands, not just from the beta-band. Additional analysis was performed to assess the strength of how much the putative signal encoding class of ordinal position (boundaries, within-sequence elements) is reflected in each frequency band. This analysis demonstrates that suppression of power in the beta-band contains the most class-related information, whereas enhancement of gamma band (31-100 Hz) activity is the second main contributor to the encoding. Our findings support the hypothesis that subthalamic nucleus-mediated gating of salient boundary elements during sequence encoding may be a prerequisite for the adequate acquisition of action sequences and the transition to habitual behaviour.

Coulthard, Elizabeth J; Bogacz, Rafal; Javed, Shazia; Mooney, Lucy K; Murphy, Gillian; Keeley, Sophie; Whone, Alan L	Distinct roles of dopamine and subthalamic nucleus in learning and probabilistic decision making.	Brain	2012	Brain. 2012 Dec;135(Pt 12):3721-34. doi: 10.1093/brain/aws273. Epub 2012 Oct 31.	Even simple behaviour requires us to make decisions based on combining multiple pieces of learned and new information. Making such decisions requires both learning the optimal response to each given stimulus as well as combining probabilistic information from multiple stimuli before selecting a response. Computational theories of decision making predict that learning individual stimulus-response associations and rapid combination of information from multiple stimuli are dependent on different components of basal ganglia circuitry. In particular, learning and retention of memory, required for optimal response choice, are significantly reliant on dopamine, whereas integrating information probabilistically is critically dependent upon functioning of the glutamatergic subthalamic nucleus (computing the 'normalization term' in Bayes' theorem). Here, we test these theories by investigating 22 patients with Parkinson's disease either treated with deep brain stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus and dopaminergic therapy or managed with dopaminergic therapy alone. We use computerized tasks that probe three cognitive functions-information acquisition (learning), memory over a delay and information integration when multiple pieces of sequentially presented information have to be combined. Patients performed the tasks ON or OFF deep brain stimulation and/or ON or OFF dopaminergic therapy. Consistent with the computational theories, we show that stopping dopaminergic therapy impairs memory for probabilistic information over a delay, whereas deep brain stimulation to the region of the subthalamic nucleus disrupts decision making when multiple pieces of acquired information must be combined. Furthermore, we found that when participants needed to update their decision on the basis of the last piece of information presented in the decision-making task, patients with deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus region did not slow down appropriately to revise their plan, a pattern of behaviour that mirrors the impulsivity described clinically in some patients with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. Thus, we demonstrate distinct mechanisms for two important facets of human decision making: first, a role for dopamine in memory consolidation, and second, the critical importance of the subthalamic nucleus in successful decision making when multiple pieces of information must be combined.		20121031	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23114368
Shaikh, Aasef G; Hong, Simon; Liao, Ke; Tian, Jing; Solomon, David; Zee, David S; Leigh, R John; Optican, Lance M	Oculopalatal tremor explained by a model of inferior olivary hypertrophy and cerebellar plasticity.	Brain	2010	Brain. 2010 Mar;133(Pt 3):923-40. doi: 10.1093/brain/awp323. Epub 2010 Jan 15.	The inferior olivary nuclei clearly play a role in creating oculopalatal tremor, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Oculopalatal tremor develops some time after a lesion in the brain that interrupts inhibition of the inferior olive by the deep cerebellar nuclei. Over time the inferior olive gradually becomes hypertrophic and its neurons enlarge developing abnormal soma-somatic gap junctions. However, results from several experimental studies have confounded the issue because they seem inconsistent with a role for the inferior olive in oculopalatal tremor, or because they ascribe the tremor to other brain areas. Here we look at 3D binocular eye movements in 15 oculopalatal tremor patients and compare their behaviour to the output of our recent mathematical model of oculopalatal tremor. This model has two mechanisms that interact to create oculopalatal tremor: an oscillator in the inferior olive and a modulator in the cerebellum. Here we show that this dual mechanism model can reproduce the basic features of oculopalatal tremor and plausibly refute the confounding experimental results. Oscillations in all patients and simulations were aperiodic, with a complicated frequency spectrum showing dominant components from 1 to 3 Hz. The model's synchronized inferior olive output was too small to induce noticeable ocular oscillations, requiring amplification by the cerebellar cortex. Simulations show that reducing the influence of the cerebellar cortex on the oculomotor pathway reduces the amplitude of ocular tremor, makes it more periodic and pulse-like, but leaves its frequency unchanged. Reducing the coupling among cells in the inferior olive decreases the oscillation's amplitude until they stop (at approximately 20% of full coupling strength), but does not change their frequency. The dual-mechanism model accounts for many of the properties of oculopalatal tremor. Simulations suggest that drug therapies designed to reduce electrotonic coupling within the inferior olive or reduce the disinhibition of the cerebellar cortex on the deep cerebellar nuclei could treat oculopalatal tremor. We conclude that oculopalatal tremor oscillations originate in the hypertrophic inferior olive and are amplified by learning in the cerebellum.		20100115	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20080879
Sicotte, N L; Kern, K C; Giesser, B S; Arshanapalli, A; Schultz, A; Montag, M; Wang, H; Bookheimer, S Y	Regional hippocampal atrophy in multiple sclerosis.	Brain	2008	Brain. 2008 Apr;131(Pt 4):1134-41. doi: 10.1093/brain/awn030.	Gray matter brain structures, including deep nuclei and the cerebral cortex, are affected significantly and early in the course of multiple sclerosis and these changes may not be directly related to demyelinating white matter lesions. The hippocampus is an archicortical structure that is critical for memory functions and is especially sensitive to multiple insults including inflammation. We used high-resolution MR imaging at 3.0 T to measure hippocampal volumes in relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) patients and controls. We found that both groups of MS patients had hippocampal atrophy and that this volume loss was in excess of global brain atrophy. Subregional analysis revealed selective volume loss in the cornu ammonis (CA) 1 region of the hippocampus in RRMS with further worsening of CA1 loss and extension into other CA regions in SPMS. Hippocampal atrophy was not correlated with T2-lesion volumes, and right and left hippocampi were affected equally. Volume loss in the hippocampus and subregions was correlated with worsening performance on word-list learning, a task requiring memory encoding, but not with performance on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), a test of information processing speed. Our findings provide evidence for selective and progressive hippocampal atrophy in MS localized initially to the CA1 subregion that is associated with deficits in memory encoding and retrieval. The underlying histopathological substrate for this selective, symmetric and disproportionate regional hippocampal vulnerability remains speculative at this time. Further understanding of this process could provide targets for therapeutic interventions including neuroprotective treatments.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18375977
Sevin, Mathieu; Lesca, Gaetan; Baumann, Nicole; Millat, Gilles; Lyon-Caen, Olivier; Vanier, Marie T; Sedel, Frederic	The adult form of Niemann-Pick disease type C.	Brain	2007	Brain. 2007 Jan;130(Pt 1):120-33. doi: 10.1093/brain/awl260. Epub 2006 Sep 26.	Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a fatal neurovisceral lipid storage disease of autosomal inheritance resulting from mutations in either the NPC1 (95% of families) or NPC2 gene. The encoded proteins appear to be involved in lysosomal/late endosomal transport of cholesterol, glycolipids and other molecules but their exact function is still unknown. The clinical spectrum of the disease ranges from a neonatal rapidly fatal disorder to an adult-onset chronic neurodegenerative disease. Based upon a comprehensive study of 13 unrelated adult patients diagnosed in France over the past 20 years as well as the analysis of the 55 other cases published since 1969, we have attempted to delineate the major clinical, radiological, biochemical and genotypic characteristics of adult NPC. Overall, mean age at onset (+/-SD) of neuropsychiatric symptoms was 25 +/- 9.7 years. The diagnosis of NPC was established after a mean delay of 6.2 +/- 6.4 years and the mean age at death (calculated from 20 cases) was 38 +/- 10.2 years. Major clinical features included cerebellar ataxia (76%), vertical supranuclear ophthalmoplegia (VSO, 75%), dysarthria, (63%), cognitive troubles (61%), movement disorders (58%), splenomegaly (54%), psychiatric disorders (45%) and dysphagia (37%). Less frequent signs were epilepsy and cataplexy. During the course of the disease, clinical features could be subdivided into (i) visceral signs (hepatomegaly or splenomegaly), (ii) cortical signs (psychiatric cognitive disorders and epilepsy); and (iii) deep brain signs (VSO, ataxia, movement disorders, dysarthria, dysphagia, cataplexy) which exhibited different evolution patterns. Asymptomatic and non-evolutive visceral signs were often noticed since early childhood (38.5% of our patients), followed by mild cortical signs in childhood (learning difficulties) and early adulthood (62% of cases among which 38% were psychiatric disorders). Deep brain signs were observed in 96% of patients and were usually responsible for death. In general, there was a good correlation between clinical signs and the localization of brain atrophy on MRI. The 'variant' biochemical phenotype characterized by mild abnormalities of the cellular trafficking of endocytosed cholesterol was over-represented in the adult form of NPC and seemed associated with less frequent splenomegaly in childhood and lesser psychiatric signs. Involvement of the NPC1 gene was shown in 33 families and of the NPC2 gene in one. Improving the knowledge of the disease among psychiatrists and neurologists appears essential since emerging treatments should be more efficient at the visceral or cognitive/psychiatric stages of the disease, before the occurrence of widespread deep brain neurological lesions.		20060926	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17003072

Brain	2000	Brain. 2000 Oct;123 ( Pt 10):2091-108. doi: 10.1093/brain/123.10.2091.	The aim of this study was to examine possible neuropsychological changes in patients with advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease treated with bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Eleven patients (age = 67 +/- 8 years, years with Parkinson's disease = 15 +/- 3, verbal IQ = 114 +/- 12) were evaluated (in their best 'on state') with tests assessing processes reliant on the functional integrity of frontal striatal circuitry, prior to the procedure (n = 11), at 3-6 months (n = 11) and at 9-12 months (n =10) post-operatively. Six of these patients were older than 69 years. Despite clinical motor benefits at 3-6 months post-operative, significant declines were noted in working memory, speed of mental processing, bimanual motor speed and co-ordination, set switching, phonemic fluency, long-term consolidation of verbal material and the encoding of visuospatial material. Declines were more consistently observed in patients who were older than 69 years, leading to a mental state comparable with progressive supranuclear palsy. 'Frontal' behavioural dyscontrol without the benefit of insight was also reported by half (three of six) of the caregivers of the elderly subgroup. At 9-12 months postoperative, only learning based on multiple trials had recovered. Tasks reliant on the integrity of frontal striatal circuitry either did not recover or gradually worsened over time. Bilateral STN DBS can have a negative impact on various aspects of frontal executive functioning, especially in patients older than 69 years. Future studies will evaluate a larger group of patients and examine the possible reversibility of these effects by turning the DBS off.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11004126

Brain	2000	Brain. 2000 Jun;123 ( Pt 6):1142-54. doi: 10.1093/brain/123.6.1142.	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) improves Parkinson's disease and increases frontal blood flow. We assessed the effects of bilateral DBS on executive function in Parkinson's disease patients, seven with electrodes implanted in the STN and six in the GPi. Patients were assessed off medication with stimulators off, on and off again. The groups showed differential change with stimulation on the Reitan Trail-Making test (TMT B) (STN more improved) and on some measures of random number generation and Wisconsin Card Sorting (STN improved, GPi worse with stimulation). Across the groups, stimulation speeded up responding (Stroop control trial, TMT A) and improved performance on paced serial addition and missing digit tests. Conversely, conditional associative learning became more errorful with stimulation across the two groups. In general, change in performance with stimulation was significant for the STN but not the GPi group. These results support two opposite predictions. In support of current models of Parkinson's disease, 'releasing the brake' on frontal function with DBS improved aspects of executive function. Conversely, disruption of basal ganglia outflow during DBS impaired performance on tests requiring changing behaviour in novel contexts as predicted by Marsden and Obeso in 1994.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10825353
Maruff, P; Burns, C B; Tyler, P; Currie, B J; Currie, J	Neurological and cognitive abnormalities associated with chronic petrol sniffing.	Brain	1998	Brain. 1998 Oct;121 ( Pt 10):1903-17. doi: 10.1093/brain/121.10.1903.	Substance abuse through the deliberate inhalation of petrol (petrol sniffing or gasoline sniffing) is prevalent in inner-urban and remote rural communities. Although acute toxic encephalopathy is a well-documented consequence of petrol sniffing, the neurological and cognitive effects of chronic petrol sniffing are unknown. A structured neurological examination and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) were used to assess neurological and cognitive function in 33 current-sniffers (individuals who had sniffed petrol for >6 months), 30 ex-sniffers (individuals who had sniffed petrol in the past but had abstained for 6 months) and 34 matched non-sniffers (individuals who had never sniffed petrol). No subject was, or had been, encephalopathic from petrol sniffing and all were residing in their community. Blood lead and hydrocarbon levels and information about petrol sniffing behaviour were obtained from each subject. When compared with non-sniffers, current-sniffers showed higher rates of abnormal tandem gait, rapid alternating hand movements, finger to nose movements, postural tremor, bilateral palmomental reflexes and brisk deep reflexes. Cognitive deficits occurred in the areas of visual attention, visual recognition memory and visual paired associate learning. Ex-petrol sniffers showed higher rates of abnormal tandem gait and bilateral palmomental reflexes and cognitive deficits in the areas of visual recognition memory and pattern-location paired associate learning. Blood lead levels and length of time of petrol sniffing correlated significantly with the magnitude of neurological and cognitive deficits. Blood hydrocarbon levels were not related to neurocognitive deficits, although this may have been due to methodological difficulties in obtaining hydrocarbon levels. These results suggest that subtle neurological and cognitive abnormalities do occur in individuals who abuse petrol but who do not have acute toxic encephalopathy and that the severity of these abnormalities is reduced with abstinence.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9798746
