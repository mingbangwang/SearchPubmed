Biol Psychiatry	2020	Biol Psychiatry. 2020 Dec 1;88(11):818-828. doi: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2020.02.016. Epub 2020 Feb 27.	The neuroimaging community has witnessed a paradigm shift in biomarker discovery from using traditional univariate brain mapping approaches to multivariate predictive models, allowing the field to move toward a translational neuroscience era. Regression-based multivariate models (hereafter "predictive modeling") provide a powerful and widely used approach to predict human behavior with neuroimaging features. These studies maintain a focus on decoding individual differences in a continuously behavioral phenotype from neuroimaging data, opening up an exciting opportunity to describe the human brain at the single-subject level. In this survey, we provide an overview of recent studies that utilize machine learning approaches to identify neuroimaging predictors over the past decade. We first review regression-based approaches and highlight connectome-based predictive modeling, which has grown in popularity in recent years. Next, we systematically describe recent representative studies using these tools in the context of cognitive function, symptom severity, personality traits, and emotion processing. Finally, we highlight a few challenges related to combining multimodal data, longitudinal prediction, external validations, and the employment of deep learning methods that have emerged from our review of the existing literature, as well as present some promising and challenging future directions.		20200227	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32336400
Rodriguez-Romaguera, Jose; Greenberg, Benjamin D; Rasmussen, Steven A; Quirk, Gregory J	An Avoidance-Based Rodent Model of Exposure With Response Prevention Therapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.	Biol Psychiatry	2016	Biol Psychiatry. 2016 Oct 1;80(7):534-40. doi: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.02.012. Epub 2016 Feb 17.	BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder is treated with exposure with response prevention (ERP) therapy, in which patients are repeatedly exposed to compulsive triggers but prevented from expressing their compulsions. Many compulsions are an attempt to avoid perceived dangers, and the intent of ERP is to extinguish compulsions. Patients failing ERP therapy are candidates for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum, which facilitates patients' response to ERP therapy. An animal model of ERP would be useful for understanding the neural mechanisms of extinction in obsessive-compulsive disorder. METHODS: Using a platform-mediated signaled avoidance task, we developed a rodent model of ERP called extinction with response prevention (Ext-RP), in which avoidance-conditioned rats are given extinction trials while blocking access to the avoidance platform. Following 3 days of Ext-RP, rats were tested with the platform unblocked to evaluate persistent avoidance. We then assessed if pharmacologic inactivation of lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) or DBS of the ventral striatum reduced persistent avoidance. RESULTS: Following Ext-RP training, most rats showed reduced avoidance at test (Ext-RP success), but a subset persisted in their avoidance (Ext-RP failure). Pharmacologic inactivation of lOFC eliminated persistent avoidance, as did DBS applied to the ventral striatum during Ext-RP. CONCLUSIONS: DBS of ventral striatum has been previously shown to inhibit lOFC activity. Thus, activity in lOFC, which is known to be hyperactive in obsessive-compulsive disorder, may be responsible for impairing patients' response to ERP therapy.

Biol Psychiatry	2015	Biol Psychiatry. 2015 Oct 1;78(7):485-95. doi: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.01.017. Epub 2015 Feb 7.	BACKGROUND: Quantitative genetic analysis of basic mouse behaviors is a powerful tool to identify novel genetic phenotypes contributing to neurobehavioral disorders. Here, we analyzed genetic contributions to single-trial, long-term social and nonsocial recognition and subsequently studied the functional impact of an identified candidate gene on behavioral development. METHODS: Genetic mapping of single-trial social recognition was performed in chromosome substitution strains, a sophisticated tool for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) of complex traits. Follow-up occurred by generating and testing knockout (KO) mice of a selected QTL candidate gene. Functional characterization of these mice was performed through behavioral and neurological assessments across developmental stages and analyses of gene expression and brain morphology. RESULTS: Chromosome substitution strain 14 mapping studies revealed an overlapping QTL related to long-term social and object recognition harboring Pcdh9, a cell-adhesion gene previously associated with autism spectrum disorder. Specific long-term social and object recognition deficits were confirmed in homozygous (KO) Pcdh9-deficient mice, while heterozygous mice only showed long-term social recognition impairment. The recognition deficits in KO mice were not associated with alterations in perception, multi-trial discrimination learning, sociability, behavioral flexibility, or fear memory. Rather, KO mice showed additional impairments in sensorimotor development reflected by early touch-evoked biting, rotarod performance, and sensory gating deficits. This profile emerged with structural changes in deep layers of sensory cortices, where Pcdh9 is selectively expressed. CONCLUSIONS: This behavior-to-gene study implicates Pcdh9 in cognitive functions required for long-term social and nonsocial recognition. This role is supported by the involvement of Pcdh9 in sensory cortex development and sensorimotor phenotypes.

Forget, Benoit; Pushparaj, Abhiram; Le Foll, Bernard	Granular insular cortex inactivation as a novel therapeutic strategy for nicotine addiction.	Biol Psychiatry	2010	Biol Psychiatry. 2010 Aug 1;68(3):265-71. doi: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.01.029. Epub 2010 Mar 17.	BACKGROUND: Nicotine is the principal component of tobacco smoke, resulting in addiction, and recent evidence suggests that damage to the insular cortex (insula) disrupts tobacco addiction in human smokers. However, the effect of an inactivation of this structure in an animal model of nicotine addiction has yet to be evaluated. METHODS: To study this question, we investigated the effects of reversible inactivation of the granular insula by local injection of a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists mixture (baclofen/muscimol) on nicotine self-administration (SA) under fixed and progressive ratio and on reinstatement of nicotine seeking induced by nicotine priming or nicotine-associated cues in rats. We also evaluated the effects of granular insula inactivation on food SA and relapse as a control. RESULTS: The inactivation of the granular insula decreased nicotine SA under both fixed and progressive ratios without affecting the SA of food under the same schedules of reinforcement. This inactivation also prevented the reinstatement, after extinction, of nicotine seeking induced by nicotine-associated cues or nicotine priming without modifying the reinstatement of food seeking. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the integrity of the granular insula is necessary for exhibiting motivation to take nicotine and to relapse to nicotine seeking but not for consuming food pellets or to relapse for food seeking. Indeed, it might be interesting to study the effect of methods that are able to modulate the activity of the insula--such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or deep brain stimulation--on tobacco addiction and relapse in humans.		20100317	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20299008
Bonner-Jackson, Aaron; Csernansky, John G; Barch, Deanna M	Levels-of-processing effects in first-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia.	Biol Psychiatry	2007	Biol Psychiatry. 2007 May 15;61(10):1141-7. doi: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.07.006. Epub 2006 Nov 21.	BACKGROUND: First-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia show cognitive impairments that are similar to but less severe than their ill relatives. We have shown that memory impairments can be improved and prefrontal cortical (PFC) activity increased in individuals with schizophrenia by providing beneficial encoding strategies. The current study used a similar paradigm to determine whether siblings of individuals with schizophrenia (SIBs) also show increases in brain activity when presented with beneficial encoding strategies. METHODS: Twenty-one SIBs and 38 siblings of healthy comparison subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scans while engaged in deep (abstract/concrete judgments) and shallow (orthographic judgments) encoding. Subjects were then given a recognition memory test. RESULTS: The groups did not differ on encoding or recognition accuracy, and the SIBs benefited from deep encoding to a similar degree as control subjects. The SIBs showed deep encoding-related activity in a number of PFC regions typically activated during semantic processing. However, SIBs showed more activity than control subjects in three subregions of PFC (left BA 44 & BA 47 bilaterally). CONCLUSIONS: Siblings of individuals with schizophrenia benefit from supportive verbal encoding conditions. Like individuals with schizophrenia, SIBs also show increased task-related activity in a larger number of PFC subregions than control subjects during deep verbal encoding.		20061121	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17123479
