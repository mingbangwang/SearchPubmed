Routhier, Etienne; Pierre, Edgard; Khodabandelou, Ghazaleh; Mozziconacci, Julien	Genome-wide prediction of DNA mutation effect on nucleosome positions for yeast synthetic genomics.	Genome Res	2020	Genome Res. 2020 Dec 18. pii: gr.264416.120. doi: 10.1101/gr.264416.120.	Genetically modified genomes are often used today in many areas of fundamental and applied research. In many studies, coding or noncoding regions are modified in order to change protein sequences or gene expression levels. Modifying one or several nucleotides in a genome can also lead to unexpected changes in the epigenetic regulation of genes. When designing a synthetic genome with many mutations, it would thus be very informative to be able to predict the effect of these mutations on chromatin. We develop here a deep learning approach that quantifies the effect of every possible single mutation on nucleosome positions on the full Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. This type of annotation track can be used when designing a modified S. cerevisiae genome. We further highlight how this track can provide new insights on the sequence-dependent mechanisms that drive nucleosomes' positions in vivo.		20201218	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33355297

Genome Res	2020	Genome Res. 2020 Sep;30(9):1345-1353. doi: 10.1101/gr.260836.120. Epub 2020 Sep 9.	Nanopore sequencing enables direct measurement of RNA molecules without conversion to cDNA, thus opening the gates to a new era for RNA biology. However, the lack of molecular barcoding of direct RNA nanopore sequencing data sets severely affects the applicability of this technology to biological samples, where RNA availability is often limited. Here, we provide the first experimental protocol and associated algorithm to barcode and demultiplex direct RNA nanopore sequencing data sets. Specifically, we present a novel and robust approach to accurately classify raw nanopore signal data by transforming current intensities into images or arrays of pixels, followed by classification using a deep learning algorithm. We demonstrate the power of this strategy by developing the first experimental protocol for barcoding and demultiplexing direct RNA sequencing libraries. Our method, DeePlexiCon, can classify 93% of reads with 95.1% accuracy or 60% of reads with 99.9% accuracy. The availability of an efficient and simple multiplexing strategy for native RNA sequencing will improve the cost-effectiveness of this technology, as well as facilitate the analysis of lower-input biological samples. Overall, our work exemplifies the power, simplicity, and robustness of signal-to-image conversion for nanopore data analysis using deep learning.		20200909	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32907883

Genome Res	2020	Genome Res. 2020 Dec;30(12):1815-1834. doi: 10.1101/gr.260844.120. Epub 2020 Jul 30.	Deciphering the genomic regulatory code of enhancers is a key challenge in biology because this code underlies cellular identity. A better understanding of how enhancers work will improve the interpretation of noncoding genome variation and empower the generation of cell type-specific drivers for gene therapy. Here, we explore the combination of deep learning and cross-species chromatin accessibility profiling to build explainable enhancer models. We apply this strategy to decipher the enhancer code in melanoma, a relevant case study owing to the presence of distinct melanoma cell states. We trained and validated a deep learning model, called DeepMEL, using chromatin accessibility data of 26 melanoma samples across six different species. We show the accuracy of DeepMEL predictions on the CAGI5 challenge, where it significantly outperforms existing models on the melanoma enhancer of IRF4 Next, we exploit DeepMEL to analyze enhancer architectures and identify accurate transcription factor binding sites for the core regulatory complexes in the two different melanoma states, with distinct roles for each transcription factor, in terms of nucleosome displacement or enhancer activation. Finally, DeepMEL identifies orthologous enhancers across distantly related species, where sequence alignment fails, and the model highlights specific nucleotide substitutions that underlie enhancer turnover. DeepMEL can be used from the Kipoi database to predict and optimize candidate enhancers and to prioritize enhancer mutations. In addition, our computational strategy can be applied to other cancer or normal cell types.		20200730	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32732264
Ghanbari, Mahsa; Ohler, Uwe	Deep neural networks for interpreting RNA-binding protein target preferences.	Genome Res	2020	Genome Res. 2020 Feb;30(2):214-226. doi: 10.1101/gr.247494.118. Epub 2020 Jan 28.	Deep learning has become a powerful paradigm to analyze the binding sites of regulatory factors including RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), owing to its strength to learn complex features from possibly multiple sources of raw data. However, the interpretability of these models, which is crucial to improve our understanding of RBP binding preferences and functions, has not yet been investigated in significant detail. We have designed a multitask and multimodal deep neural network for characterizing in vivo RBP targets. The model incorporates not only the sequence but also the region type of the binding sites as input, which helps the model to boost the prediction performance. To interpret the model, we quantified the contribution of the input features to the predictive score of each RBP. Learning across multiple RBPs at once, we are able to avoid experimental biases and to identify the RNA sequence motifs and transcript context patterns that are the most important for the predictions of each individual RBP. Our findings are consistent with known motifs and binding behaviors and can provide new insights about the regulatory functions of RBPs.		20200128	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31992613
Vainberg Slutskin, Ilya; Weinberger, Adina; Segal, Eran	Sequence determinants of polyadenylation-mediated regulation.	Genome Res	2019	Genome Res. 2019 Oct;29(10):1635-1647. doi: 10.1101/gr.247312.118. Epub 2019 Sep 17.	The cleavage and polyadenylation reaction is a crucial step in transcription termination and pre-mRNA maturation in human cells. Despite extensive research, the encoding of polyadenylation-mediated regulation of gene expression within the DNA sequence is not well understood. Here, we utilized a massively parallel reporter assay to inspect the effect of over 12,000 rationally designed polyadenylation sequences (PASs) on reporter gene expression and cleavage efficiency. We find that the PAS sequence can modulate gene expression by over five orders of magnitude. By using a uniquely designed scanning mutagenesis data set, we gain mechanistic insight into various modes of action by which the cleavage efficiency affects the sensitivity or robustness of the PAS to mutation. Furthermore, we employ motif discovery to identify both known and novel sequence motifs associated with PAS-mediated regulation. By leveraging the large scale of our data, we train a deep learning model for the highly accurate prediction of RNA levels from DNA sequence alone (R = 0.83). Moreover, we devise unique approaches for predicting exact cleavage sites for our reporter constructs and for endogenous transcripts. Taken together, our results expand our understanding of PAS-mediated regulation, and provide an unprecedented resource for analyzing and predicting PAS for regulatory genomics applications.		20190917	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31530582
Guo, Yuchun; Tian, Kevin; Zeng, Haoyang; Guo, Xiaoyun; Gifford, David Kenneth	A novel k-mer set memory (KSM) motif representation improves regulatory variant prediction.	Genome Res	2018	Genome Res. 2018 Jun;28(6):891-900. doi: 10.1101/gr.226852.117. Epub 2018 Apr 13.	The representation and discovery of transcription factor (TF) sequence binding specificities is critical for understanding gene regulatory networks and interpreting the impact of disease-associated noncoding genetic variants. We present a novel TF binding motif representation, the k-mer set memory (KSM), which consists of a set of aligned k-mers that are overrepresented at TF binding sites, and a new method called KMAC for de novo discovery of KSMs. We find that KSMs more accurately predict in vivo binding sites than position weight matrix (PWM) models and other more complex motif models across a large set of ChIP-seq experiments. Furthermore, KSMs outperform PWMs and more complex motif models in predicting in vitro binding sites. KMAC also identifies correct motifs in more experiments than five state-of-the-art motif discovery methods. In addition, KSM-derived features outperform both PWM and deep learning model derived sequence features in predicting differential regulatory activities of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) alleles. Finally, we have applied KMAC to 1600 ENCODE TF ChIP-seq data sets and created a public resource of KSM and PWM motifs. We expect that the KSM representation and KMAC method will be valuable in characterizing TF binding specificities and in interpreting the effects of noncoding genetic variations.		20180413	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29654070
Cuperus, Josh T; Groves, Benjamin; Kuchina, Anna; Rosenberg, Alexander B; Jojic, Nebojsa; Fields, Stanley; Seelig, Georg	Deep learning of the regulatory grammar of yeast 5' untranslated regions from 500,000 random sequences.	Genome Res	2017	Genome Res. 2017 Dec;27(12):2015-2024. doi: 10.1101/gr.224964.117. Epub 2017 Nov 2.	Our ability to predict protein expression from DNA sequence alone remains poor, reflecting our limited understanding of cis-regulatory grammar and hampering the design of engineered genes for synthetic biology applications. Here, we generate a model that predicts the protein expression of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed a library of half a million 50-nucleotide-long random 5' UTRs and assayed their activity in a massively parallel growth selection experiment. The resulting data allow us to quantify the impact on protein expression of Kozak sequence composition, upstream open reading frames (uORFs), and secondary structure. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the random library and showed that it performs well at predicting the protein expression of both a held-out set of the random 5' UTRs as well as native S. cerevisiae 5' UTRs. The model additionally was used to computationally evolve highly active 5' UTRs. We confirmed experimentally that the great majority of the evolved sequences led to higher protein expression rates than the starting sequences, demonstrating the predictive power of this model.		20171102	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29097404
Kelley, David R; Snoek, Jasper; Rinn, John L	Basset: learning the regulatory code of the accessible genome with deep convolutional neural networks.	Genome Res	2016	Genome Res. 2016 Jul;26(7):990-9. doi: 10.1101/gr.200535.115. Epub 2016 May 3.	The complex language of eukaryotic gene expression remains incompletely understood. Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanisms. Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a recent machine learning advance-deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.		20160503	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27197224

Deep characterization of molecular function of genetic variants in the human genome is becoming increasingly important for understanding genetic associations to disease and for learning to read the regulatory code of the genome. In this paper, I discuss how recent advances in both quantitative genetics and molecular biology have contributed to understanding functional effects of genetic variants, lessons learned from eQTL studies, and future challenges in this field.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26430152
Gorkin, David U; Lee, Dongwon; Reed, Xylena; Fletez-Brant, Christopher; Bessling, Seneca L; Loftus, Stacie K; Beer, Michael A; Pavan, William J; McCallion, Andrew S	Integration of ChIP-seq and machine learning reveals enhancers and a predictive regulatory sequence vocabulary in melanocytes.	Genome Res	2012	Genome Res. 2012 Nov;22(11):2290-301. doi: 10.1101/gr.139360.112. Epub 2012 Sep 27.	We take a comprehensive approach to the study of regulatory control of gene expression in melanocytes that proceeds from large-scale enhancer discovery facilitated by ChIP-seq; to rigorous validation in silico, in vitro, and in vivo; and finally to the use of machine learning to elucidate a regulatory vocabulary with genome-wide predictive power. We identify 2489 putative melanocyte enhancer loci in the mouse genome by ChIP-seq for EP300 and H3K4me1. We demonstrate that these putative enhancers are evolutionarily constrained, enriched for sequence motifs predicted to bind key melanocyte transcription factors, located near genes relevant to melanocyte biology, and capable of driving reporter gene expression in melanocytes in culture (86%; 43/50) and in transgenic zebrafish (70%; 7/10). Next, using the sequences of these putative enhancers as a training set for a supervised machine learning algorithm, we develop a vocabulary of 6-mers predictive of melanocyte enhancer function. Lastly, we demonstrate that this vocabulary has genome-wide predictive power in both the mouse and human genomes. This study provides deep insight into the regulation of gene expression in melanocytes and demonstrates a powerful approach to the investigation of regulatory sequences that can be applied to other cell types.		20120927	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23019145
Morin, Ryan D; Aksay, Gozde; Dolgosheina, Elena; Ebhardt, H Alexander; Magrini, Vincent; Mardis, Elaine R; Sahinalp, S Cenk; Unrau, Peter J	Comparative analysis of the small RNA transcriptomes of Pinus contorta and Oryza sativa.	Genome Res	2008	Genome Res. 2008 Apr;18(4):571-84. doi: 10.1101/gr.6897308. Epub 2008 Mar 6.	The diversity of microRNAs and small-interfering RNAs has been extensively explored within angiosperms by focusing on a few key organisms such as Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana. A deeper division of the plants is defined by the radiation of the angiosperms and gymnosperms, with the latter comprising the commercially important conifers. The conifers are expected to provide important information regarding the evolution of highly conserved small regulatory RNAs. Deep sequencing provides the means to characterize and quantitatively profile small RNAs in understudied organisms such as these. Pyrosequencing of small RNAs from O. sativa revealed, as expected, approximately 21- and approximately 24-nt RNAs. The former contained known microRNAs, and the latter largely comprised intergenic-derived sequences likely representing heterochromatin siRNAs. In contrast, sequences from Pinus contorta were dominated by 21-nt small RNAs. Using a novel sequence-based clustering algorithm, we identified sequences belonging to 18 highly conserved microRNA families in P. contorta as well as numerous clusters of conserved small RNAs of unknown function. Using multiple methods, including expressed sequence folding and machine learning algorithms, we found a further 53 candidate novel microRNA families, 51 appearing specific to the P. contorta library. In addition, alignment of small RNA sequences to the O. sativa genome revealed six perfectly conserved classes of small RNA that included chloroplast transcripts and specific types of genomic repeats. The conservation of microRNAs and other small RNAs between the conifers and the angiosperms indicates that important RNA silencing processes were highly developed in the earliest spermatophytes. Genomic mapping of all sequences to the O. sativa genome can be viewed at http://microrna.bcgsc.ca/cgi-bin/gbrowse/rice_build_3/.		20080306	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18323537
