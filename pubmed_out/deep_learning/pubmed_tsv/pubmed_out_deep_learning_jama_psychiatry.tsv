Ewbank, Michael P; Cummins, Ronan; Tablan, Valentin; Bateup, Sarah; Catarino, Ana; Martin, Alan J; Blackwell, Andrew D	Quantifying the Association Between Psychotherapy Content and Clinical Outcomes Using Deep Learning.	JAMA Psychiatry	2020	JAMA Psychiatry. 2020 Jan 1;77(1):35-43. doi: 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.2664.	Importance: Compared with the treatment of physical conditions, the quality of care of mental health disorders remains poor and the rate of improvement in treatment is slow, a primary reason being the lack of objective and systematic methods for measuring the delivery of psychotherapy. Objective: To use a deep learning model applied to a large-scale clinical data set of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) session transcripts to generate a quantifiable measure of treatment delivered and to determine the association between the quantity of each aspect of therapy delivered and clinical outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: All data were obtained from patients receiving internet-enabled CBT for the treatment of a mental health disorder between June 2012 and March 2018 in England. Cognitive behavioral therapy was delivered in a secure online therapy room via instant synchronous messaging. The initial sample comprised a total of 17572 patients (90934 therapy session transcripts). Patients self-referred or were referred by a primary health care worker directly to the service. Exposures: All patients received National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence-approved disorder-specific CBT treatment protocols delivered by a qualified CBT therapist. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical outcomes were measured in terms of reliable improvement in patient symptoms and treatment engagement. Reliable improvement was calculated based on 2 severity measures: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), corresponding to depressive and anxiety symptoms respectively, completed by the patient at initial assessment and before every therapy session (see eMethods in the Supplement for details). Results: Treatment sessions from a total of 14899 patients (10882 women) aged between 18 and 94 years (median age, 34.8 years) were included in the final analysis. We trained a deep learning model to automatically categorize therapist utterances into 1 or more of 24 feature categories. The trained model was applied to our data set to obtain quantifiable measures of each feature of treatment delivered. A logistic regression revealed that increased quantities of a number of session features, including change methods (cognitive and behavioral techniques used in CBT), were associated with greater odds of reliable improvement in patient symptoms (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.06-1.17) and patient engagement (odds ratio, 1.20, 95% CI, 1.12-1.27). The quantity of nontherapy-related content was associated with reduced odds of symptom improvement (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85-0.92) and patient engagement (odds ratio, 0.88, 95% CI, 0.84-0.92). Conclusions and Relevance: This work demonstrates an association between clinical outcomes in psychotherapy and the content of therapist utterances. These findings support the principle that CBT change methods help produce improvements in patients' presenting symptoms. The application of deep learning to large clinical data sets can provide valuable insights into psychotherapy, informing the development of new treatments and helping standardize clinical practice.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31436785

JAMA Psychiatry	2018	JAMA Psychiatry. 2018 Oct 1;75(10):1081-1087. doi: 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.0930.	Importance: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common and often debilitating psychiatric illness. Recent advances in the understanding of the neuroscience of OCD have provided valuable insights that have begun to transform the way we think about the management of this disorder. This educational review provides an integrated neuroscience perspective on formulation and treatment planning for patients with OCD. The article is organized around key neuroscience themes most relevant for OCD. Observations: An integrated neuroscience formulation of OCD is predicated on a fundamental understanding of phenomenology and symptom dimensions, fear conditioning and extinction, neurochemistry, genetics and animal models, as well as neurocircuitry and neurotherapeutics. Symptom dimensions provide a means to better understand the phenotypic heterogeneity within OCD with an eye toward more personalized treatments. The concept of abnormal fear extinction is central to OCD and to the underlying therapeutic mechanism of exposure and response prevention. A framework for understanding the neurochemistry of OCD focuses on both traditional monoaminergic systems and more recent evidence of glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic dysfunction. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is highly heritable, and future work is needed to understand the contribution of genes to underlying pathophysiology. A circuit dysregulation framework focuses on cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit dysfunction and the development of neurotherapeutic approaches targeting this circuit. The impact of these concepts on how we think about OCD diagnosis and treatment is discussed. Suggestions for future investigations that have the potential to further enhance the clinical management of OCD are presented. Conclusions and Relevance: These key neuroscience themes collectively inform formulation and treatment planning for patients with OCD. The ultimate goal is to increase crosstalk between clinicians and researchers in an effort to facilitate translation of advances in neuroscience research to improved care for patients with OCD.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30140845
