Albrecht, Steffen; Sprang, Maximilian; Andrade-Navarro, Miguel A; Fontaine, Jean-Fred	seqQscorer: automated quality control of next-generation sequencing data using machine learning.	Genome Biol	2021	Genome Biol. 2021 Mar 5;22(1):75. doi: 10.1186/s13059-021-02294-2.	Controlling quality of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data files is a necessary but complex task. To address this problem, we statistically characterize common NGS quality features and develop a novel quality control procedure involving tree-based and deep learning classification algorithms. Predictive models, validated on internal and external functional genomics datasets, are to some extent generalizable to data from unseen species. The derived statistical guidelines and predictive models represent a valuable resource for users of NGS data to better understand quality issues and perform automatic quality control. Our guidelines and software are available at https://github.com/salbrec/seqQscorer .

Wang, Dongfang; Hou, Siyu; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Xiliang; Liu, Baolin; Zhang, Zemin	iMAP: integration of multiple single-cell datasets by adversarial paired transfer networks.	Genome Biol	2021	Genome Biol. 2021 Feb 18;22(1):63. doi: 10.1186/s13059-021-02280-8.	The integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from multiple sources is critical for deciphering cell-to-cell heterogeneities and interactions in complex biological systems. We present a novel unsupervised batch effect removal framework, called iMAP, based on both deep autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. Compared with current methods, iMAP shows superior, robust, and scalable performance in terms of both reliably detecting the batch-specific cells and effectively mixing distributions of the batch-shared cell types. Applying iMAP to tumor microenvironment datasets from two platforms, Smart-seq2 and 10x Genomics, we find that iMAP can leverage the powers of both platforms to discover novel cell-cell interactions.

Williams, Justin; Xu, Beisi; Putnam, Daniel; Thrasher, Andrew; Li, Chunliang; Yang, Jun; Chen, Xiang	MethylationToActivity: a deep-learning framework that reveals promoter activity landscapes from DNA methylomes in individual tumors.	Genome Biol	2021	Genome Biol. 2021 Jan 19;22(1):24. doi: 10.1186/s13059-020-02220-y.	Although genome-wide DNA methylomes have demonstrated their clinical value as reliable biomarkers for tumor detection, subtyping, and classification, their direct biological impacts at the individual gene level remain elusive. Here we present MethylationToActivity (M2A), a machine learning framework that uses convolutional neural networks to infer promoter activities based on H3K4me3 and H3K27ac enrichment, from DNA methylation patterns for individual genes. Using publicly available datasets in real-world test scenarios, we demonstrate that M2A is highly accurate and robust in revealing promoter activity landscapes in various pediatric and adult cancers, including both solid and hematologic malignant neoplasms.

Fortelny, Nikolaus; Bock, Christoph	Knowledge-primed neural networks enable biologically interpretable deep learning on single-cell sequencing data.	Genome Biol	2020	Genome Biol. 2020 Aug 3;21(1):190. doi: 10.1186/s13059-020-02100-5.	BACKGROUND: Deep learning has emerged as a versatile approach for predicting complex biological phenomena. However, its utility for biological discovery has so far been limited, given that generic deep neural networks provide little insight into the biological mechanisms that underlie a successful prediction. Here we demonstrate deep learning on biological networks, where every node has a molecular equivalent, such as a protein or gene, and every edge has a mechanistic interpretation, such as a regulatory interaction along a signaling pathway. RESULTS: With knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs), we exploit the ability of deep learning algorithms to assign meaningful weights in multi-layered networks, resulting in a widely applicable approach for interpretable deep learning. We present a learning method that enhances the interpretability of trained KPNNs by stabilizing node weights in the presence of redundancy, enhancing the quantitative interpretability of node weights, and controlling for uneven connectivity in biological networks. We validate KPNNs on simulated data with known ground truth and demonstrate their practical use and utility in five biological applications with single-cell RNA-seq data for cancer and immune cells. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce KPNNs as a method that combines the predictive power of deep learning with the interpretability of biological networks. While demonstrated here on single-cell sequencing data, this method is broadly relevant to other research areas where prior domain knowledge can be represented as networks.

He, Yao; Yuan, Hao; Wu, Cheng; Xie, Zhi	DISC: a highly scalable and accurate inference of gene expression and structure for single-cell transcriptomes using semi-supervised deep learning.	Genome Biol	2020	Genome Biol. 2020 Jul 10;21(1):170. doi: 10.1186/s13059-020-02083-3.	Dropouts distort gene expression and misclassify cell types in single-cell transcriptome. Although imputation may improve gene expression and downstream analysis to some degree, it also inevitably introduces false signals. We develop DISC, a novel deep learning network with semi-supervised learning to infer gene structure and expression obscured by dropouts. Compared with seven state-of-the-art imputation approaches on ten real-world datasets, we show that DISC consistently outperforms the other approaches. Its applicability, scalability, and reliability make DISC a promising approach to recover gene expression, enhance gene and cell structures, and improve cell type identification for sparse scRNA-seq data.

Genome Biol	2020	Genome Biol. 2020 Jun 29;21(1):155. doi: 10.1186/s13059-020-02077-1.	BACKGROUND: Systematic in vitro loss-of-function screens provide valuable resources that can facilitate the discovery of drugs targeting cancer vulnerabilities. RESULTS: We develop a deep learning-based method to predict tumor-specific vulnerabilities in patient samples by leveraging a wealth of in vitro screening data. Acquired dependencies of tumors are inferred in cases in which one allele is disrupted by inactivating mutations or in association with oncogenic mutations. Nucleocytoplasmic transport by Ran GTPase is identified as a common vulnerability in Her2-positive breast cancers. Vulnerability to loss of Ku70/80 is predicted for tumors that are defective in homologous recombination and rely on nonhomologous end joining for DNA repair. Our experimental validation for Ran, Ku70/80, and a proteasome subunit using patient-derived cells shows that they can be targeted specifically in particular tumors that are predicted to be dependent on them. CONCLUSION: This approach can be applied to facilitate the development of precision therapeutic targets for different tumors.		20200629	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32600395
Jha, Anupama; K Aicher, Joseph; R Gazzara, Matthew; Singh, Deependra; Barash, Yoseph	Enhanced Integrated Gradients: improving interpretability of deep learning models using splicing codes as a case study.	Genome Biol	2020	Genome Biol. 2020 Jun 19;21(1):149. doi: 10.1186/s13059-020-02055-7.	Despite the success and fast adaptation of deep learning models in biomedical domains, their lack of interpretability remains an issue. Here, we introduce Enhanced Integrated Gradients (EIG), a method to identify significant features associated with a specific prediction task. Using RNA splicing prediction as well as digit classification as case studies, we demonstrate that EIG improves upon the original Integrated Gradients method and produces sets of informative features. We then apply EIG to identify A1CF as a key regulator of liver-specific alternative splicing, supporting this finding with subsequent analysis of relevant A1CF functional (RNA-seq) and binding data (PAR-CLIP).

Schreiber, Jacob; Durham, Timothy; Bilmes, Jeffrey; Noble, William Stafford	Avocado: a multi-scale deep tensor factorization method learns a latent representation of the human epigenome.	Genome Biol	2020	Genome Biol. 2020 Mar 30;21(1):81. doi: 10.1186/s13059-020-01977-6.	The human epigenome has been experimentally characterized by thousands of measurements for every basepair in the human genome. We propose a deep neural network tensor factorization method, Avocado, that compresses this epigenomic data into a dense, information-rich representation. We use this learned representation to impute epigenomic data more accurately than previous methods, and we show that machine learning models that exploit this representation outperform those trained directly on epigenomic data on a variety of genomics tasks. These tasks include predicting gene expression, promoter-enhancer interactions, replication timing, and an element of 3D chromatin architecture.		20200330	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32228704

Genome Biol	2020	Genome Biol. 2020 Mar 26;21(1):79. doi: 10.1186/s13059-020-01987-4.	Non-coding variants have been shown to be related to disease by alteration of 3D genome structures. We propose a deep learning method, DeepMILO, to predict the effects of variants on CTCF/cohesin-mediated insulator loops. Application of DeepMILO on variants from whole-genome sequences of 1834 patients of twelve cancer types revealed 672 insulator loops disrupted in at least 10% of patients. Our results show mutations at loop anchors are associated with upregulation of the cancer driver genes BCL2 and MYC in malignant lymphoma thus pointing to a possible new mechanism for their dysregulation via alteration of insulator loops.	3D genome; BCL2; Cancer; Deep learning; MYC; Non-coding mutation	20200326	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32216817

Genome Biol	2019	Genome Biol. 2019 Nov 29;20(1):260. doi: 10.1186/s13059-019-1884-z.

Genome Biol	2019	Genome Biol. 2019 Nov 1;20(1):229. doi: 10.1186/s13059-019-1823-z.	INTRODUCTION: The ocean microbiome represents one of the largest microbiomes and produces nearly half of the primary energy on the planet through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Using recent advances in marine genomics, we explore new applications of oceanic metagenomes for protein structure and function prediction. RESULTS: By processing 1.3 TB of high-quality reads from the Tara Oceans data, we obtain 97 million non-redundant genes. Of the 5721 Pfam families that lack experimental structures, 2801 have at least one member associated with the oceanic metagenomics dataset. We apply C-QUARK, a deep-learning contact-guided ab initio structure prediction pipeline, to model 27 families, where 20 are predicted to have a reliable fold with estimated template modeling score (TM-score) at least 0.5. Detailed analyses reveal that the abundance of microbial genera in the ocean is highly correlated to the frequency of occurrence in the modeled Pfam families, suggesting the significant role of the Tara Oceans genomes in the contact-map prediction and subsequent ab initio folding simulations. Of interesting note, PF15461, which has a majority of members coming from ocean-related bacteria, is identified as an important photosynthetic protein by structure-based function annotations. The pipeline is extended to a set of 417 Pfam families, built on the combination of Tara with other metagenomics datasets, which results in 235 families with an estimated TM-score over 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a new avenue to improve the capacity of protein structure and function modeling through marine metagenomics, especially for difficult proteins with few homologous sequences.		20191101	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31676016

Genome Biol	2019	Genome Biol. 2019 Oct 18;20(1):211. doi: 10.1186/s13059-019-1837-6.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers new opportunities to study gene expression of tens of thousands of single cells simultaneously. We present DeepImpute, a deep neural network-based imputation algorithm that uses dropout layers and loss functions to learn patterns in the data, allowing for accurate imputation. Overall, DeepImpute yields better accuracy than other six publicly available scRNA-seq imputation methods on experimental data, as measured by the mean squared error or Pearson's correlation coefficient.

Johansen, Nelson; Quon, Gerald	scAlign: a tool for alignment, integration, and rare cell identification from scRNA-seq data.	Genome Biol	2019	Genome Biol. 2019 Aug 14;20(1):166. doi: 10.1186/s13059-019-1766-4.	scRNA-seq dataset integration occurs in different contexts, such as the identification of cell type-specific differences in gene expression across conditions or species, or batch effect correction. We present scAlign, an unsupervised deep learning method for data integration that can incorporate partial, overlapping, or a complete set of cell labels, and estimate per-cell differences in gene expression across datasets. scAlign performance is state-of-the-art and robust to cross-dataset variation in cell type-specific expression and cell type composition. We demonstrate that scAlign reveals gene expression programs for rare populations of malaria parasites. Our framework is widely applicable to integration challenges in other domains.

Genome Biol	2019	Genome Biol. 2019 Aug 12;20(1):165. doi: 10.1186/s13059-019-1764-6.	To fully utilize the power of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies for identifying cell lineages and bona fide transcriptional signals, it is necessary to combine data from multiple experiments. We present BERMUDA (Batch Effect ReMoval Using Deep Autoencoders), a novel transfer-learning-based method for batch effect correction in scRNA-seq data. BERMUDA effectively combines different batches of scRNA-seq data with vastly different cell population compositions and amplifies biological signals by transferring information among batches. We demonstrate that BERMUDA outperforms existing methods for removing batch effects and distinguishing cell types in multiple simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets.

Genome Biol	2019	Genome Biol. 2019 Mar 1;20(1):48. doi: 10.1186/s13059-019-1653-z.	Predicting the effects of genetic variants on splicing is highly relevant for human genetics. We describe the framework MMSplice (modular modeling of splicing) with which we built the winning model of the CAGI5 exon skipping prediction challenge. The MMSplice modules are neural networks scoring exon, intron, and splice sites, trained on distinct large-scale genomics datasets. These modules are combined to predict effects of variants on exon skipping, splice site choice, splicing efficiency, and pathogenicity, with matched or higher performance than state-of-the-art. Our models, available in the repository Kipoi, apply to variants including indels directly from VCF files.

Genome Biol	2018	Genome Biol. 2018 Jun 26;19(1):80. doi: 10.1186/s13059-018-1459-4.	A major challenge for effective application of CRISPR systems is to accurately predict the single guide RNA (sgRNA) on-target knockout efficacy and off-target profile, which would facilitate the optimized design of sgRNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. Here we present DeepCRISPR, a comprehensive computational platform to unify sgRNA on-target and off-target site prediction into one framework with deep learning, surpassing available state-of-the-art in silico tools. In addition, DeepCRISPR fully automates the identification of sequence and epigenetic features that may affect sgRNA knockout efficacy in a data-driven manner.

Genome Biol	2017	Genome Biol. 2017 Apr 11;18(1):67. doi: 10.1186/s13059-017-1189-z.	Recent technological advances have enabled DNA methylation to be assayed at single-cell resolution. However, current protocols are limited by incomplete CpG coverage and hence methods to predict missing methylation states are critical to enable genome-wide analyses. We report DeepCpG, a computational approach based on deep neural networks to predict methylation states in single cells. We evaluate DeepCpG on single-cell methylation data from five cell types generated using alternative sequencing protocols. DeepCpG yields substantially more accurate predictions than previous methods. Additionally, we show that the model parameters can be interpreted, thereby providing insights into how sequence composition affects methylation variability.

Genome Biol	2015	Genome Biol. 2015 Jun 16;16:124. doi: 10.1186/s13059-015-0688-z.	Many biological questions, including the estimation of deep evolutionary histories and the detection of remote homology between protein sequences, rely upon multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees of large datasets. However, accurate large-scale multiple sequence alignment is very difficult, especially when the dataset contains fragmentary sequences. We present UPP, a multiple sequence alignment method that uses a new machine learning technique, the ensemble of hidden Markov models, which we propose here. UPP produces highly accurate alignments for both nucleotide and amino acid sequences, even on ultra-large datasets or datasets containing fragmentary sequences.
