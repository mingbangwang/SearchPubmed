J Clin Invest	2021	J Clin Invest. 2021 Mar 2. pii: 145488. doi: 10.1172/JCI145488.	BACKGROUND: p16 positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients are potentially cured with definitive treatment. However, there are currently no reliable biomarkers of treatment failure in p16 positive OPSCC. Pathologist-based visual assessment of tumor cell multinucleation has been shown to be independently prognostic of disease-free survival in p16 positive OPSCC. However, its quantification is time-intensive, subjective, and at risk of interobserver variability. METHODS: We present a deep learning-based metric, the multi-nucleation index (MuNI), for prognostication in p16 positive OPSCC. This approach quantifies tumor multi-nucleation from digitally scanned hematoxylin eosin (H&E)-stained slides. Representative H&E whole slide images from 1,094 previously untreated p16 positive OPSCC patients were acquired from six institutions for optimizing and validating MuNI. RESULTS: MuNI was prognostic for disease-free (DFS), overall (OS), or distant metastasis-free (DMFS) survival in p16 positive OPSCC with HRs of 1.78(95%CI:1.37-2.30), 1.94(1.44-2.60), and 1.88(1.43-2.47), respectively, independent of age, smoking status, treatment type, and T/N-categories in multivariable analyses. It was also prognostic for DFS, OS, and DMFS in OPSCC patients at stages I and III. CONCLUSION: MuNI holds promise as a low-cost, tissue non-destructive, H&E stain based digital biomarker test for counseling, treatment, and surveillance of p16 positive OPSCC patients. These data support further confirmation of MuNI in prospective trials.

Tucker, Budd A; Mullins, Robert F; Stone, Edwin M	Autologous cell replacement: a noninvasive AI approach to clinical release testing.	J Clin Invest	2020	J Clin Invest. 2020 Feb 3;130(2):608-611. doi: 10.1172/JCI133821.	The advent of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provided a means for avoiding ethical concerns associated with the use of cells isolated from human embryos. The number of labs now using iPSCs to generate photoreceptor, retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE), and-more recently-choroidal endothelial cells has grown exponentially. However, for autologous cell replacement to be effective, manufacturing strategies will need to change. Many tasks carried out by hand will need simplifying and automating. In this issue of the JCI, Schaub and colleagues combined quantitative bright-field microscopy and artificial intelligence (deep neural networks and traditional machine learning) to noninvasively monitor iPSC-derived graft maturation, predict donor cell identity, and evaluate graft function prior to transplantation. This approach allowed the authors to preemptively identify and remove abnormal grafts. Notably, the method is (a) transferable, (b) cost and time effective, (c) high throughput, and (d) useful for primary product validation.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31961338

J Clin Invest	2020	J Clin Invest. 2020 Feb 3;130(2):1010-1023. doi: 10.1172/JCI131187.	Increases in the number of cell therapies in the preclinical and clinical phases have prompted the need for reliable and noninvasive assays to validate transplant function in clinical biomanufacturing. We developed a robust characterization methodology composed of quantitative bright-field absorbance microscopy (QBAM) and deep neural networks (DNNs) to noninvasively predict tissue function and cellular donor identity. The methodology was validated using clinical-grade induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells (iPSC-RPE). QBAM images of iPSC-RPE were used to train DNNs that predicted iPSC-RPE monolayer transepithelial resistance, predicted polarized vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, and matched iPSC-RPE monolayers to the stem cell donors. DNN predictions were supplemented with traditional machine-learning algorithms that identified shape and texture features of single cells that were used to predict tissue function and iPSC donor identity. These results demonstrate noninvasive cell therapy characterization can be achieved with QBAM and machine learning.
