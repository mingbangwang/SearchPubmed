Converging evidence increasingly implicates shared etiologic and pathophysiological characteristics among major psychiatric disorders (MPDs), such as schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). Examining the neurobiology of the psychotic-affective spectrum may greatly advance biological determination of psychiatric diagnosis, which is critical for the development of more effective treatments. In this study, ensemble clustering was developed to identify subtypes within a trans-diagnostic sample of MPDs. Whole brain amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) was used to extract the low-dimensional features for clustering in a total of 944 participants: 581 psychiatric patients (193 with SZ, 171 with BD, and 217 with MDD) and 363 healthy controls (HC). We identified two subtypes with differentiating patterns of functional imbalance between frontal and posterior brain regions, as compared to HC: (1) Archetypal MPDs (60% of MPDs) had increased frontal and decreased posterior ALFF, and decreased cortical thickness and white matter integrity in multiple brain regions that were associated with increased polygenic risk scores and enriched risk gene expression in brain tissues; (2) Atypical MPDs (40% of MPDs) had decreased frontal and increased posterior ALFF with no associated alterations in validity measures. Medicated Archetypal MPDs had lower symptom severity than their unmedicated counterparts; whereas medicated and unmedicated Atypical MPDs had no differences in symptom scores. Our findings suggest that frontal versus posterior functional imbalance as measured by ALFF is a novel putative trans-diagnostic biomarker differentiating subtypes of MPDs that could have implications for precision medicine.		20201001	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33005028

Epub 2019 Feb 15.	Machine and deep learning methods, today's core of artificial intelligence, have been applied with increasing success and impact in many commercial and research settings. They are powerful tools for large scale data analysis, prediction and classification, especially in very data-rich environments ("big data"), and have started to find their way into medical applications. Here we will first give an overview of machine learning methods, with a focus on deep and recurrent neural networks, their relation to statistics, and the core principles behind them. We will then discuss and review directions along which (deep) neural networks can be, or already have been, applied in the context of psychiatry, and will try to delineate their future potential in this area. We will also comment on an emerging area that so far has been much less well explored: by embedding semantically interpretable computational models of brain dynamics or behavior into a statistical machine learning context, insights into dysfunction beyond mere prediction and classification may be gained. Especially this marriage of computational models with statistical inference may offer insights into neural and behavioral mechanisms that could open completely novel avenues for psychiatric treatment.		20190215	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30770893

Mol Psychiatry	2017	Mol Psychiatry. 2017 Jun;22(6):931-934. doi: 10.1038/mp.2016.124. Epub 2016 Aug 2.	We previously reported that bilateral electrical stimulation in the anterior limb of the internal capsule/bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (IC/BST) effectively reduces symptoms in severe treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. Here we used a linear mixed model to investigate the evolution of symptomatic and functional status of our patients (n=24) and examined if baseline variables could predict this evolution. Data were collected during routine, clinical psychiatric visits. Our analysis showed a long-term, sustained effect of electrical stimulation in the IC/BST. After a fast initial decline of OCD symptoms, these symptoms remain relatively stable. In addition, we found a strong ON/OFF effect of stimulation (e.g., due to battery depletion). Our data also show that it is not the surgical procedure but rather the electrical stimulation that drives the improvement in Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at baseline was the only predictor significantly related to the evolution of the Y-BOCS. A higher BDI at baseline seemed to be related to a smaller decrease of the Y-BOCS over time. In conclusion, electrical stimulation in the IC/BST has a fast and sustained effect on OCD and comorbid symptoms and functional status of patients.		20160802	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27480493

Mol Psychiatry	2016	Mol Psychiatry. 2016 Sep;21(9):1272-80. doi: 10.1038/mp.2015.124. Epub 2015 Aug 25.	In 1998, we proposed deep brain stimulation as a last-resort treatment option for patients suffering from severe, treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Here, 24 OCD patients were included in a long-term follow-up study to evaluate the effects of electrical stimulation in the anterior limbs of the internal capsule (ALIC) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST). We find that electrical stimulation in the ALIC/BST area is safe and significantly decreases obsessions, compulsions, and associated anxiety and depressive symptoms, and improves global functioning in a blinded crossover trial (n=17), after 4 years (n=18), and at last follow-up (up to 171 months, n=24). Moreover, our data indicate that BST may be a better stimulation target compared with ALIC to alleviate OCD symptoms. We conclude that electrical stimulation in BST is a promising therapeutic option for otherwise treatment-resistant OCD patients.		20150825	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26303665

Mol Psychiatry	2010	Mol Psychiatry. 2010 Jan;15(1):64-79. doi: 10.1038/mp.2008.55. Epub 2008 May 20.	Psychiatric neurosurgery teams in the United States and Europe have studied deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule and adjacent ventral striatum (VC/VS) for severe and highly treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder. Four groups have collaborated most closely, in small-scale studies, over the past 8 years. First to begin was Leuven/Antwerp, followed by Butler Hospital/Brown Medical School, the Cleveland Clinic and most recently the University of Florida. These centers used comparable patient selection criteria and surgical targeting. Targeting, but not selection, evolved during this period. Here, we present combined long-term results of those studies, which reveal clinically significant symptom reductions and functional improvement in about two-thirds of patients. DBS was well tolerated overall and adverse effects were overwhelmingly transient. Results generally improved for patients implanted more recently, suggesting a 'learning curve' both within and across centers. This is well known from the development of DBS for movement disorders. The main factor accounting for these gains appears to be the refinement of the implantation site. Initially, an anterior-posterior location based on anterior capsulotomy lesions was used. In an attempt to improve results, more posterior sites were investigated resulting in the current target, at the junction of the anterior capsule, anterior commissure and posterior ventral striatum. Clinical results suggest that neural networks relevant to therapeutic improvement might be modulated more effectively at a more posterior target. Taken together, these data show that the procedure can be successfully implemented by dedicated interdisciplinary teams, and support its therapeutic promise.		20080520	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18490925
