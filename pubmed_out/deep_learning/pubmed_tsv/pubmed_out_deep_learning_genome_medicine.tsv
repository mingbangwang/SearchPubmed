Genome Med	2021	Genome Med. 2021 Mar 11;13(1):42. doi: 10.1186/s13073-021-00845-7.	BACKGROUND: Contemporary deep learning approaches show cutting-edge performance in a variety of complex prediction tasks. Nonetheless, the application of deep learning in healthcare remains limited since deep learning methods are often considered as non-interpretable black-box models. However, the machine learning community made recent elaborations on interpretability methods explaining data point-specific decisions of deep learning techniques. We believe that such explanations can assist the need in personalized precision medicine decisions via explaining patient-specific predictions. METHODS: Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is a technique to explain decisions of deep learning methods. It is widely used to interpret Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied on image data. Recently, CNNs started to extend towards non-Euclidean domains like graphs. Molecular networks are commonly represented as graphs detailing interactions between molecules. Gene expression data can be assigned to the vertices of these graphs. In other words, gene expression data can be structured by utilizing molecular network information as prior knowledge. Graph-CNNs can be applied to structured gene expression data, for example, to predict metastatic events in breast cancer. Therefore, there is a need for explanations showing which part of a molecular network is relevant for predicting an event, e.g., distant metastasis in cancer, for each individual patient. RESULTS: We extended the procedure of LRP to make it available for Graph-CNN and tested its applicability on a large breast cancer dataset. We present Graph Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (GLRP) as a new method to explain the decisions made by Graph-CNNs. We demonstrate a sanity check of the developed GLRP on a hand-written digits dataset and then apply the method on gene expression data. We show that GLRP provides patient-specific molecular subnetworks that largely agree with clinical knowledge and identify common as well as novel, and potentially druggable, drivers of tumor progression. CONCLUSIONS: The developed method could be potentially highly useful on interpreting classification results in the context of different omics data and prior knowledge molecular networks on the individual patient level, as for example in precision medicine approaches or a molecular tumor board.

Rentzsch, Philipp; Schubach, Max; Shendure, Jay; Kircher, Martin	CADD-Splice-improving genome-wide variant effect prediction using deep learning-derived splice scores.	Genome Med	2021	Genome Med. 2021 Feb 22;13(1):31. doi: 10.1186/s13073-021-00835-9.	BACKGROUND: Splicing of genomic exons into mRNAs is a critical prerequisite for the accurate synthesis of human proteins. Genetic variants impacting splicing underlie a substantial proportion of genetic disease, but are challenging to identify beyond those occurring at donor and acceptor dinucleotides. To address this, various methods aim to predict variant effects on splicing. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to achieve better results in predicting splice variants than other strategies. METHODS: It has been unclear how best to integrate such process-specific scores into genome-wide variant effect predictors. Here, we use a recently published experimental data set to compare several machine learning methods that score variant effects on splicing. We integrate the best of those approaches into general variant effect prediction models and observe the effect on classification of known pathogenic variants. RESULTS: We integrate two specialized splicing scores into CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion; cadd.gs.washington.edu ), a widely used tool for genome-wide variant effect prediction that we previously developed to weight and integrate diverse collections of genomic annotations. With this new model, CADD-Splice, we show that inclusion of splicing DNN effect scores substantially improves predictions across multiple variant categories, without compromising overall performance. CONCLUSIONS: While splice effect scores show superior performance on splice variants, specialized predictors cannot compete with other variant scores in general variant interpretation, as the latter account for nonsense and missense effects that do not alter splicing. Although only shown here for splice scores, we believe that the applied approach will generalize to other specific molecular processes, providing a path for the further improvement of genome-wide variant effect prediction.		20210222	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33618777
Dias, Raquel; Torkamani, Ali	Artificial intelligence in clinical and genomic diagnostics.	Genome Med	2019	Genome Med. 2019 Nov 19;11(1):70. doi: 10.1186/s13073-019-0689-8.	Artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems that are able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Advances in AI software and hardware, especially deep learning algorithms and the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power their training, have led to a recent and rapidly increasing interest in medical AI applications. In clinical diagnostics, AI-based computer vision approaches are poised to revolutionize image-based diagnostics, while other AI subtypes have begun to show similar promise in various diagnostic modalities. In some areas, such as clinical genomics, a specific type of AI algorithm known as deep learning is used to process large and complex genomic datasets. In this review, we first summarize the main classes of problems that AI systems are well suited to solve and describe the clinical diagnostic tasks that benefit from these solutions. Next, we focus on emerging methods for specific tasks in clinical genomics, including variant calling, genome annotation and variant classification, and phenotype-to-genotype correspondence. Finally, we end with a discussion on the future potential of AI in individualized medicine applications, especially for risk prediction in common complex diseases, and the challenges, limitations, and biases that must be carefully addressed for the successful deployment of AI in medical applications, particularly those utilizing human genetics and genomics data.		20191119	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31744524

Genome Med	2017	Genome Med. 2017 Nov 30;9(1):105. doi: 10.1186/s13073-017-0488-z.	BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder associated with IQ deficits. Rare copy number variations (CNVs) have been established to play an important role in the etiology of schizophrenia. Several of the large rare CNVs associated with schizophrenia have been shown to negatively affect IQ in population-based controls where no major neuropsychiatric disorder is reported. The aim of this study was to examine the diagnostic yield of microarray testing and the functional impact of genome-wide rare CNVs in a community ascertained cohort of adults with schizophrenia and low (< 85) or average (>/= 85) IQ. METHODS: We recruited 546 adults of European ancestry with schizophrenia from six community psychiatric clinics in Canada. Each individual was assigned to the low or average IQ group based on standardized tests and/or educational attainment. We used rigorous methods to detect genome-wide rare CNVs from high-resolution microarray data. We compared the burden of rare CNVs classified as pathogenic or as a variant of unknown significance (VUS) between each of the IQ groups and the genome-wide burden and functional impact of rare CNVs after excluding individuals with a pathogenic CNV. RESULTS: There were 39/546 (7.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.2-9.7%) schizophrenia participants with at least one pathogenic CNV detected, significantly more of whom were from the low IQ group (odds ratio [OR] = 5.01 [2.28-11.03], p = 0.0001). Secondary analyses revealed that individuals with schizophrenia and average IQ had the lowest yield of pathogenic CNVs (n = 9/325; 2.8%), followed by those with borderline intellectual functioning (n = 9/130; 6.9%), non-verbal learning disability (n = 6/29; 20.7%), and co-morbid intellectual disability (n = 15/62; 24.2%). There was no significant difference in the burden of rare CNVs classified as a VUS between any of the IQ subgroups. There was a significantly (p=0.002) increased burden of rare genic duplications in individuals with schizophrenia and low IQ that persisted after excluding individuals with a pathogenic CNV. CONCLUSIONS: Using high-resolution microarrays we were able to demonstrate for the first time that the burden of pathogenic CNVs in schizophrenia differs significantly between IQ subgroups. The results of this study have implications for clinical practice and may help inform future rare variant studies of schizophrenia using next-generation sequencing technologies.

Kalatskaya, Irina; Trinh, Quang M; Spears, Melanie; McPherson, John D; Bartlett, John M S; Stein, Lincoln	ISOWN: accurate somatic mutation identification in the absence of normal tissue controls.	Genome Med	2017	Genome Med. 2017 Jun 29;9(1):59. doi: 10.1186/s13073-017-0446-9.	BACKGROUND: A key step in cancer genome analysis is the identification of somatic mutations in the tumor. This is typically done by comparing the genome of the tumor to the reference genome sequence derived from a normal tissue taken from the same donor. However, there are a variety of common scenarios in which matched normal tissue is not available for comparison. RESULTS: In this work, we describe an algorithm to distinguish somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in next-generation sequencing data from germline polymorphisms in the absence of normal samples using a machine learning approach. Our algorithm was evaluated using a family of supervised learning classifications across six different cancer types and ~1600 samples, including cell lines, fresh frozen tissues, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues; we tested our algorithm with both deep targeted and whole-exome sequencing data. Our algorithm correctly classified between 95 and 98% of somatic mutations with F1-measure ranges from 75.9 to 98.6% depending on the tumor type. We have released the algorithm as a software package called ISOWN (Identification of SOmatic mutations Without matching Normal tissues). CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we describe the development, implementation, and validation of ISOWN, an accurate algorithm for predicting somatic mutations in cancer tissues in the absence of matching normal tissues.
