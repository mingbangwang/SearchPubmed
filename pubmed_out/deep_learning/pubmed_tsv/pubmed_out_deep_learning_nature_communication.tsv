Naito, Tatsuhiko; Suzuki, Ken; Hirata, Jun; Kamatani, Yoichiro; Matsuda, Koichi; Toda, Tatsushi; Okada, Yukinori	A deep learning method for HLA imputation and trans-ethnic MHC fine-mapping of type 1 diabetes.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Mar 12;12(1):1639. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21975-x.	Conventional human leukocyte antigen (HLA) imputation methods drop their performance for infrequent alleles, which is one of the factors that reduce the reliability of trans-ethnic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) fine-mapping due to inter-ethnic heterogeneity in allele frequency spectra. We develop DEEP*HLA, a deep learning method for imputing HLA genotypes. Through validation using the Japanese and European HLA reference panels (n = 1,118 and 5,122), DEEP*HLA achieves the highest accuracies with significant superiority for low-frequency and rare alleles. DEEP*HLA is less dependent on distance-dependent linkage disequilibrium decay of the target alleles and might capture the complicated region-wide information. We apply DEEP*HLA to type 1 diabetes GWAS data from BioBank Japan (n = 62,387) and UK Biobank (n = 354,459), and successfully disentangle independently associated class I and II HLA variants with shared risk among diverse populations (the top signal at amino acid position 71 of HLA-DRbeta1; P = 7.5 x 10(-120)). Our study illustrates the value of deep learning in genotype imputation and trans-ethnic MHC fine-mapping.		20210312	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712626

Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Mar 12;12(1):1637. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21674-7.	N-staging is a determining factor for prognostic assessment and decision-making for stage-based cancer therapeutic strategies. Visual inspection of whole-slides of intact lymph nodes is currently the main method used by pathologists to calculate the number of metastatic lymph nodes (MLNs). Moreover, even at the same N stage, the outcome of patients varies dramatically. Here, we propose a deep-learning framework for analyzing lymph node whole-slide images (WSIs) to identify lymph nodes and tumor regions, and then to uncover tumor-area-to-MLN-area ratio (T/MLN). After training, our model's tumor detection performance was comparable to that of experienced pathologists and achieved similar performance on two independent gastric cancer validation cohorts. Further, we demonstrate that T/MLN is an interpretable independent prognostic factor. These findings indicate that deep-learning models could assist not only pathologists in detecting lymph nodes with metastases but also oncologists in exploring new prognostic factors, especially those that are difficult to calculate manually.		20210312	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712598

Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Mar 12;12(1):1613. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21896-9.	Computational methods have made substantial progress in improving the accuracy and throughput of pathology workflows for diagnostic, prognostic, and genomic prediction. Still, lack of interpretability remains a significant barrier to clinical integration. We present an approach for predicting clinically-relevant molecular phenotypes from whole-slide histopathology images using human-interpretable image features (HIFs). Our method leverages >1.6 million annotations from board-certified pathologists across >5700 samples to train deep learning models for cell and tissue classification that can exhaustively map whole-slide images at two and four micron-resolution. Cell- and tissue-type model outputs are combined into 607 HIFs that quantify specific and biologically-relevant characteristics across five cancer types. We demonstrate that these HIFs correlate with well-known markers of the tumor microenvironment and can predict diverse molecular signatures (AUROC 0.601-0.864), including expression of four immune checkpoint proteins and homologous recombination deficiency, with performance comparable to 'black-box' methods. Our HIF-based approach provides a comprehensive, quantitative, and interpretable window into the composition and spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment.		20210312	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712588
Sidhom, John-William; Larman, H Benjamin; Pardoll, Drew M; Baras, Alexander S	DeepTCR is a deep learning framework for revealing sequence concepts within T-cell repertoires.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Mar 11;12(1):1605. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21879-w.	Deep learning algorithms have been utilized to achieve enhanced performance in pattern-recognition tasks. The ability to learn complex patterns in data has tremendous implications in immunogenomics. T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing assesses the diversity of the adaptive immune system and allows for modeling its sequence determinants of antigenicity. We present DeepTCR, a suite of unsupervised and supervised deep learning methods able to model highly complex TCR sequencing data by learning a joint representation of a TCR by its CDR3 sequences and V/D/J gene usage. We demonstrate the utility of deep learning to provide an improved 'featurization' of the TCR across multiple human and murine datasets, including improved classification of antigen-specific TCRs and extraction of antigen-specific TCRs from noisy single-cell RNA-Seq and T-cell culture-based assays. Our results highlight the flexibility and capacity for deep neural networks to extract meaningful information from complex immunogenomic data for both descriptive and predictive purposes.		20210311	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33707415
Vitsios, Dimitrios; Dhindsa, Ryan S; Middleton, Lawrence; Gussow, Ayal B; Petrovski, Slave	Prioritizing non-coding regions based on human genomic constraint and sequence context with deep learning.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Mar 8;12(1):1504. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21790-4.	Elucidating functionality in non-coding regions is a key challenge in human genomics. It has been shown that intolerance to variation of coding and proximal non-coding sequence is a strong predictor of human disease relevance. Here, we integrate intolerance to variation, functional genomic annotations and primary genomic sequence to build JARVIS: a comprehensive deep learning model to prioritize non-coding regions, outperforming other human lineage-specific scores. Despite being agnostic to evolutionary conservation, JARVIS performs comparably or outperforms conservation-based scores in classifying pathogenic single-nucleotide and structural variants. In constructing JARVIS, we introduce the genome-wide residual variation intolerance score (gwRVIS), applying a sliding-window approach to whole genome sequencing data from 62,784 individuals. gwRVIS distinguishes Mendelian disease genes from more tolerant CCDS regions and highlights ultra-conserved non-coding elements as the most intolerant regions in the human genome. Both JARVIS and gwRVIS capture previously inaccessible human-lineage constraint information and will enhance our understanding of the non-coding genome.		20210308	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33686085
Fan, Zhao; Ma, Evan	Predicting orientation-dependent plastic susceptibility from static structure in amorphous solids via deep learning.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Mar 8;12(1):1506. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21806-z.	It has been a long-standing materials science challenge to establish structure-property relations in amorphous solids. Here we introduce a rotationally non-invariant local structure representation that enables different predictions for different loading orientations, which is found essential for high-fidelity prediction of the propensity for stress-driven shear transformations. This novel structure representation, when combined with convolutional neural network (CNN), a powerful deep learning algorithm, leads to unprecedented accuracy for identifying atoms with high propensity for shear transformations (i.e., plastic susceptibility), solely from the static structure in both two- and three-dimensional model glasses. The data-driven models trained on samples at one composition and a given processing history are found transferrable to glass samples with different processing histories or at different compositions in the same alloy system. Our analysis of the new structure representation also provides valuable insight into key atomic packing features that influence the local mechanical response and its anisotropy in glasses.		20210308	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33686082
Lal, Avantika; Chiang, Zachary D; Yakovenko, Nikolai; Duarte, Fabiana M; Israeli, Johnny; Buenrostro, Jason D	Deep learning-based enhancement of epigenomics data with AtacWorks.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Mar 8;12(1):1507. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21765-5.	ATAC-seq is a widely-applied assay used to measure genome-wide chromatin accessibility; however, its ability to detect active regulatory regions can depend on the depth of sequencing coverage and the signal-to-noise ratio. Here we introduce AtacWorks, a deep learning toolkit to denoise sequencing coverage and identify regulatory peaks at base-pair resolution from low cell count, low-coverage, or low-quality ATAC-seq data. Models trained by AtacWorks can detect peaks from cell types not seen in the training data, and are generalizable across diverse sample preparations and experimental platforms. We demonstrate that AtacWorks enhances the sensitivity of single-cell experiments by producing results on par with those of conventional methods using ~10 times as many cells, and further show that this framework can be adapted to enable cross-modality inference of protein-DNA interactions. Finally, we establish that AtacWorks can enable new biological discoveries by identifying active regulatory regions associated with lineage priming in rare subpopulations of hematopoietic stem cells.		20210308	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33686069
Kuang, Wenhuan; Yuan, Congcong; Zhang, Jie	Real-time determination of earthquake focal mechanism via deep learning.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Mar 4;12(1):1432. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21670-x.	An immediate report of the source focal mechanism with full automation after a destructive earthquake is crucial for timely characterizing the faulting geometry, evaluating the stress perturbation, and assessing the aftershock patterns. Advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been introduced to solve various problems in real-time seismology, but the real-time source focal mechanism is still a challenge. Here we propose a novel deep learning method namely Focal Mechanism Network (FMNet) to address this problem. The FMNet trained with 787,320 synthetic samples successfully estimates the focal mechanisms of four 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes with magnitude larger than Mw 5.4. The network learns the global waveform characteristics from theoretical data, thereby allowing the extensive applications of the proposed method to regions of potential seismic hazards with or without historical earthquake data. After receiving data, the network takes less than two hundred milliseconds for predicting the source focal mechanism reliably on a single CPU.		20210304	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33664244
Giambagli, Lorenzo; Buffoni, Lorenzo; Carletti, Timoteo; Nocentini, Walter; Fanelli, Duccio	Machine learning in spectral domain.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Feb 26;12(1):1330. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21481-0.	Deep neural networks are usually trained in the space of the nodes, by adjusting the weights of existing links via suitable optimization protocols. We here propose a radically new approach which anchors the learning process to reciprocal space. Specifically, the training acts on the spectral domain and seeks to modify the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of transfer operators in direct space. The proposed method is ductile and can be tailored to return either linear or non-linear classifiers. Adjusting the eigenvalues, when freezing the eigenvectors entries, yields performances that are superior to those attained with standard methods restricted to operate with an identical number of free parameters. To recover a feed-forward architecture in direct space, we have postulated a nested indentation of the eigenvectors. Different non-orthogonal basis could be employed to export the spectral learning to other frameworks, as e.g. reservoir computing.		20210226	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33637729
Wang, Qi; Kille, Bryce; Liu, Tian Rui; Elworth, R A Leo; Treangen, Todd J	PlasmidHawk improves lab of origin prediction of engineered plasmids using sequence alignment.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Feb 26;12(1):1167. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21180-w.	With advances in synthetic biology and genome engineering comes a heightened awareness of potential misuse related to biosafety concerns. A recent study employed machine learning to identify the lab-of-origin of DNA sequences to help mitigate some of these concerns. Despite their promising results, this deep learning based approach had limited accuracy, was computationally expensive to train, and wasn't able to provide the precise features that were used in its predictions. To address these shortcomings, we developed PlasmidHawk for lab-of-origin prediction. Compared to a machine learning approach, PlasmidHawk has higher prediction accuracy; PlasmidHawk can successfully predict unknown sequences' depositing labs 76% of the time and 85% of the time the correct lab is in the top 10 candidates. In addition, PlasmidHawk can precisely single out the signature sub-sequences that are responsible for the lab-of-origin detection. In summary, PlasmidHawk represents an explainable and accurate tool for lab-of-origin prediction of synthetic plasmid sequences.

Hiranuma, Naozumi; Park, Hahnbeom; Baek, Minkyung; Anishchenko, Ivan; Dauparas, Justas; Baker, David	Improved protein structure refinement guided by deep learning based accuracy estimation.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Feb 26;12(1):1340. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21511-x.	We develop a deep learning framework (DeepAccNet) that estimates per-residue accuracy and residue-residue distance signed error in protein models and uses these predictions to guide Rosetta protein structure refinement. The network uses 3D convolutions to evaluate local atomic environments followed by 2D convolutions to provide their global contexts and outperforms other methods that similarly predict the accuracy of protein structure models. Overall accuracy predictions for X-ray and cryoEM structures in the PDB correlate with their resolution, and the network should be broadly useful for assessing the accuracy of both predicted structure models and experimentally determined structures and identifying specific regions likely to be in error. Incorporation of the accuracy predictions at multiple stages in the Rosetta refinement protocol considerably increased the accuracy of the resulting protein structure models, illustrating how deep learning can improve search for global energy minima of biomolecules.		20210226	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33637700

Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Feb 24;12(1):1259. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21466-z.	It is still challenging to make accurate diagnosis of biliary atresia (BA) with sonographic gallbladder images particularly in rural area without relevant expertise. To help diagnose BA based on sonographic gallbladder images, an ensembled deep learning model is developed. The model yields a patient-level sensitivity 93.1% and specificity 93.9% [with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.956 (95% confidence interval: 0.928-0.977)] on the multi-center external validation dataset, superior to that of human experts. With the help of the model, the performances of human experts with various levels are improved. Moreover, the diagnosis based on smartphone photos of sonographic gallbladder images through a smartphone app and based on video sequences by the model still yields expert-level performances. The ensembled deep learning model in this study provides a solution to help radiologists improve the diagnosis of BA in various clinical application scenarios, particularly in rural and undeveloped regions with limited expertise.		20210224	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33627641
Chen, Chi-Long; Chen, Chi-Chung; Yu, Wei-Hsiang; Chen, Szu-Hua; Chang, Yu-Chan; Hsu, Tai-I; Hsiao, Michael; Yeh, Chao-Yuan; Chen, Cheng-Yu	An annotation-free whole-slide training approach to pathological classification of lung cancer types using deep learning.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Feb 19;12(1):1193. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21467-y.	Deep learning for digital pathology is hindered by the extremely high spatial resolution of whole-slide images (WSIs). Most studies have employed patch-based methods, which often require detailed annotation of image patches. This typically involves laborious free-hand contouring on WSIs. To alleviate the burden of such contouring and obtain benefits from scaling up training with numerous WSIs, we develop a method for training neural networks on entire WSIs using only slide-level diagnoses. Our method leverages the unified memory mechanism to overcome the memory constraint of compute accelerators. Experiments conducted on a data set of 9662 lung cancer WSIs reveal that the proposed method achieves areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9594 and 0.9414 for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma classification on the testing set, respectively. Furthermore, the method demonstrates higher classification performance than multiple-instance learning as well as strong localization results for small lesions through class activation mapping.		20210219	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33608558
Meier, Florian; Kohler, Niklas D; Brunner, Andreas-David; Wanka, Jean-Marc H; Voytik, Eugenia; Strauss, Maximilian T; Theis, Fabian J; Mann, Matthias	Deep learning the collisional cross sections of the peptide universe from a million experimental values.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Feb 19;12(1):1185. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21352-8.	The size and shape of peptide ions in the gas phase are an under-explored dimension for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. To investigate the nature and utility of the peptide collisional cross section (CCS) space, we measure more than a million data points from whole-proteome digests of five organisms with trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) and parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF). The scale and precision (CV < 1%) of our data is sufficient to train a deep recurrent neural network that accurately predicts CCS values solely based on the peptide sequence. Cross section predictions for the synthetic ProteomeTools peptides validate the model within a 1.4% median relative error (R > 0.99). Hydrophobicity, proportion of prolines and position of histidines are main determinants of the cross sections in addition to sequence-specific interactions. CCS values can now be predicted for any peptide and organism, forming a basis for advanced proteomics workflows that make full use of the additional information.		20210219	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33608539
Ding, Xinqiang; Lin, Xingcheng; Zhang, Bin	Stability and folding pathways of tetra-nucleosome from six-dimensional free energy surface.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Feb 17;12(1):1091. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21377-z.	The three-dimensional organization of chromatin is expected to play critical roles in regulating genome functions. High-resolution characterization of its structure and dynamics could improve our understanding of gene regulation mechanisms but has remained challenging. Using a near-atomistic model that preserves the chemical specificity of protein-DNA interactions at residue and base-pair resolution, we studied the stability and folding pathways of a tetra-nucleosome. Dynamical simulations performed with an advanced sampling technique uncovered multiple pathways that connect open chromatin configurations with the zigzag crystal structure. Intermediate states along the simulated folding pathways resemble chromatin configurations reported from in situ experiments. We further determined a six-dimensional free energy surface as a function of the inter-nucleosome distances via a deep learning approach. The zigzag structure can indeed be seen as the global minimum of the surface. However, it is not favored by a significant amount relative to the partially unfolded, in situ configurations. Chemical perturbations such as histone H4 tail acetylation and thermal fluctuations can further tilt the energetic balance to stabilize intermediate states. Our study provides insight into the connection between various reported chromatin configurations and has implications on the in situ relevance of the 30 nm fiber.		20210217	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33597548

Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Feb 16;12(1):1066. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21311-3.	Pelvic radiograph (PXR) is essential for detecting proximal femur and pelvis injuries in trauma patients, which is also the key component for trauma survey. None of the currently available algorithms can accurately detect all kinds of trauma-related radiographic findings on PXRs. Here, we show a universal algorithm can detect most types of trauma-related radiographic findings on PXRs. We develop a multiscale deep learning algorithm called PelviXNet trained with 5204 PXRs with weakly supervised point annotation. PelviXNet yields an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.973 (95% CI, 0.960-0.983) and an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.963 (95% CI, 0.948-0.974) in the clinical population test set of 1888 PXRs. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity at the cutoff value are 0.924 (95% CI, 0.912-0.936), 0.908 (95% CI, 0.885-0.908), and 0.932 (95% CI, 0.919-0.946), respectively. PelviXNet demonstrates comparable performance with radiologists and orthopedics in detecting pelvic and hip fractures.		20210216	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33594071
Sato, Kengo; Akiyama, Manato; Sakakibara, Yasubumi	RNA secondary structure prediction using deep learning with thermodynamic integration.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Feb 11;12(1):941. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21194-4.	Accurate predictions of RNA secondary structures can help uncover the roles of functional non-coding RNAs. Although machine learning-based models have achieved high performance in terms of prediction accuracy, overfitting is a common risk for such highly parameterized models. Here we show that overfitting can be minimized when RNA folding scores learnt using a deep neural network are integrated together with Turner's nearest-neighbor free energy parameters. Training the model with thermodynamic regularization ensures that folding scores and the calculated free energy are as close as possible. In computational experiments designed for newly discovered non-coding RNAs, our algorithm (MXfold2) achieves the most robust and accurate predictions of RNA secondary structures without sacrificing computational efficiency compared to several other algorithms. The results suggest that integrating thermodynamic information could help improve the robustness of deep learning-based predictions of RNA secondary structure.		20210211	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33574226

Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Feb 10;12(1):936. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21291-4.	Patch clamp recording of neurons is a labor-intensive and time-consuming procedure. Here, we demonstrate a tool that fully automatically performs electrophysiological recordings in label-free tissue slices. The automation covers the detection of cells in label-free images, calibration of the micropipette movement, approach to the cell with the pipette, formation of the whole-cell configuration, and recording. The cell detection is based on deep learning. The model is trained on a new image database of neurons in unlabeled brain tissue slices. The pipette tip detection and approaching phase use image analysis techniques for precise movements. High-quality measurements are performed on hundreds of human and rodent neurons. We also demonstrate that further molecular and anatomical analysis can be performed on the recorded cells. The software has a diary module that automatically logs patch clamp events. Our tool can multiply the number of daily measurements to help brain research.		20210210	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33568670
George, Tom M; Manucharyan, Georgy E; Thompson, Andrew F	Deep learning to infer eddy heat fluxes from sea surface height patterns of mesoscale turbulence.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Feb 5;12(1):800. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-20779-9.	Mesoscale eddies have strong signatures in sea surface height (SSH) anomalies that are measured globally through satellite altimetry. However, monitoring the transport of heat associated with these eddies and its impact on the global ocean circulation remains difficult as it requires simultaneous observations of upper-ocean velocity fields and interior temperature and density properties. Here we demonstrate that for quasigeostrophic baroclinic turbulence the eddy patterns in SSH snapshots alone contain sufficient information to estimate the eddy heat fluxes. We use simulations of baroclinic turbulence for the supervised learning of a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict up to 64% of eddy heat flux variance. CNNs also significantly outperform other conventional data-driven techniques. Our results suggest that deep CNNs could provide an effective pathway towards an operational monitoring of eddy heat fluxes using satellite altimetry and other remote sensing products.		20210205	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33547299

Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Feb 4;12(1):789. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-20753-5.	Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) has been previously used to profile multiple parameters in two dimensions in single cells within tissue slices. Here, a mathematical and technical framework for three-dimensional (3D) subcellular MIBI is presented. Ion-beam tomography (IBT) compiles ion beam images that are acquired iteratively across successive, multiple scans, and later assembled into a 3D format without loss of depth resolution. Algorithmic deconvolution, tailored for ion beams, is then applied to the transformed ion image series, yielding 4-fold enhanced ion beam data cubes. To further generate 3D sub-ion-beam-width precision visuals, isolated ion molecules are localized in the raw ion beam images, creating an approach coined as SILM, secondary ion beam localization microscopy, providing sub-25 nm accuracy in original ion images. Using deep learning, a parameter-free reconstruction method for ion beam tomograms with high accuracy is developed for low-density targets. In cultured cancer cells and tissues, IBT enables accessible visualization of 3D volumetric distributions of genomic regions, RNA transcripts, and protein factors with 5 nm axial resolution using isotope-enrichments and label-free elemental analyses. Multiparameter imaging of subcellular features at near macromolecular resolution is implemented by the IBT tools as a general biocomputation pipeline for imaging mass spectrometry.		20210204	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33542220

Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Jan 29;12(1):715. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-20966-2.	Coronary artery calcium is an accurate predictor of cardiovascular events. While it is visible on all computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, this information is not routinely quantified as it requires expertise, time, and specialized equipment. Here, we show a robust and time-efficient deep learning system to automatically quantify coronary calcium on routine cardiac-gated and non-gated CT. As we evaluate in 20,084 individuals from distinct asymptomatic (Framingham Heart Study, NLST) and stable and acute chest pain (PROMISE, ROMICAT-II) cohorts, the automated score is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, independent of risk factors (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios up to 4.3), shows high correlation with manual quantification, and robust test-retest reliability. Our results demonstrate the clinical value of a deep learning system for the automated prediction of cardiovascular events. Implementation into clinical practice would address the unmet need of automating proven imaging biomarkers to guide management and improve population health.		20210129	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33514711

Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Jan 27;12(1):634. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-20657-4.	The SARS-COV-2 pandemic has put pressure on intensive care units, so that identifying predictors of disease severity is a priority. We collect 58 clinical and biological variables, and chest CT scan data, from 1003 coronavirus-infected patients from two French hospitals. We train a deep learning model based on CT scans to predict severity. We then construct the multimodal AI-severity score that includes 5 clinical and biological variables (age, sex, oxygenation, urea, platelet) in addition to the deep learning model. We show that neural network analysis of CT-scans brings unique prognosis information, although it is correlated with other markers of severity (oxygenation, LDH, and CRP) explaining the measurable but limited 0.03 increase of AUC obtained when adding CT-scan information to clinical variables. Here, we show that when comparing AI-severity with 11 existing severity scores, we find significantly improved prognosis performance; AI-severity can therefore rapidly become a reference scoring approach.		20210127	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33504775
Qi, Hongjian; Zhang, Haicang; Zhao, Yige; Chen, Chen; Long, John J; Chung, Wendy K; Guan, Yongtao; Shen, Yufeng	MVP predicts the pathogenicity of missense variants by deep learning.	Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Jan 21;12(1):510. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-20847-0.	Accurate pathogenicity prediction of missense variants is critically important in genetic studies and clinical diagnosis. Previously published prediction methods have facilitated the interpretation of missense variants but have limited performance. Here, we describe MVP (Missense Variant Pathogenicity prediction), a new prediction method that uses deep residual network to leverage large training data sets and many correlated predictors. We train the model separately in genes that are intolerant of loss of function variants and the ones that are tolerant in order to take account of potentially different genetic effect size and mode of action. We compile cancer mutation hotspots and de novo variants from developmental disorders for benchmarking. Overall, MVP achieves better performance in prioritizing pathogenic missense variants than previous methods, especially in genes tolerant of loss of function variants. Finally, using MVP, we estimate that de novo coding variants contribute to 7.8% of isolated congenital heart disease, nearly doubling previous estimates.		20210121	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33479230

Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Jan 15;12(1):400. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-20492-7.	Promoter DNA methylation is a well-established mechanism of transcription repression, though its global correlation with gene expression is weak. This weak correlation can be attributed to the failure of current methylation quantification methods to consider the heterogeneity among sequenced bulk cells. Here, we introduce Cell Heterogeneity-Adjusted cLonal Methylation (CHALM) as a methylation quantification method. CHALM improves understanding of the functional consequences of DNA methylation, including its correlations with gene expression and H3K4me3. When applied to different methylation datasets, the CHALM method enables detection of differentially methylated genes that exhibit distinct biological functions supporting underlying mechanisms.		20210115	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33452255

Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Jan 13;12(1):353. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-20655-6.	Recent critical commentaries unfavorably compare deep learning (DL) with standard machine learning (SML) approaches for brain imaging data analysis. However, their conclusions are often based on pre-engineered features depriving DL of its main advantage - representation learning. We conduct a large-scale systematic comparison profiled in multiple classification and regression tasks on structural MRI images and show the importance of representation learning for DL. Results show that if trained following prevalent DL practices, DL methods have the potential to scale particularly well and substantially improve compared to SML methods, while also presenting a lower asymptotic complexity in relative computational time, despite being more complex. We also demonstrate that DL embeddings span comprehensible task-specific projection spectra and that DL consistently localizes task-discriminative brain biomarkers. Our findings highlight the presence of nonlinearities in neuroimaging data that DL can exploit to generate superior task-discriminative representations for characterizing the human brain.		20210113	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33441557

Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Jan 13;12(1):363. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-20581-7.	Aberrant neural oscillations hallmark numerous brain disorders. Here, we first report a method to track the phase of neural oscillations in real-time via endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT) that mitigates the characteristic Gibbs distortion. We then used ecHT to show that the aberrant neural oscillation that hallmarks essential tremor (ET) syndrome, the most common adult movement disorder, can be transiently suppressed via transcranial electrical stimulation of the cerebellum phase-locked to the tremor. The tremor suppression is sustained shortly after the end of the stimulation and can be phenomenologically predicted. Finally, we use feature-based statistical-learning and neurophysiological-modelling to show that the suppression of ET is mechanistically attributed to a disruption of the temporal coherence of the aberrant oscillations in the olivocerebellar loop, thus establishing its causal role. The suppression of aberrant neural oscillation via phase-locked driven disruption of temporal coherence may in the future represent a powerful neuromodulatory strategy to treat brain disorders.		20210113	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33441542

Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Jan 11;12(1):257. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-20213-0.	Advances in deep learning technology have enabled complex task solutions. The accuracy of image classification tasks has improved owing to the establishment of convolutional neural networks (CNN). Cellular senescence is a hallmark of ageing and is important for the pathogenesis of ageing-related diseases. Furthermore, it is a potential therapeutic target. Specific molecular markers are used to identify senescent cells. Moreover senescent cells show unique morphology, which can be identified. We develop a successful morphology-based CNN system to identify senescent cells and a quantitative scoring system to evaluate the state of endothelial cells by senescence probability output from pre-trained CNN optimised for the classification of cellular senescence, Deep Learning-Based Senescence Scoring System by Morphology (Deep-SeSMo). Deep-SeSMo correctly evaluates the effects of well-known anti-senescent reagents. We screen for drugs that control cellular senescence using a kinase inhibitor library by Deep-SeSMo-based drug screening and identify four anti-senescent drugs. RNA sequence analysis reveals that these compounds commonly suppress senescent phenotypes through inhibition of the inflammatory response pathway. Thus, morphology-based CNN system can be a powerful tool for anti-senescent drug screening.		20210111	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33431893

Nat Commun	2021	Nat Commun. 2021 Jan 4;12(1):37. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-20268-z.	Recent advances in deep learning have been providing non-intuitive solutions to various inverse problems in optics. At the intersection of machine learning and optics, diffractive networks merge wave-optics with deep learning to design task-specific elements to all-optically perform various tasks such as object classification and machine vision. Here, we present a diffractive network, which is used to shape an arbitrary broadband pulse into a desired optical waveform, forming a compact and passive pulse engineering system. We demonstrate the synthesis of various different pulses by designing diffractive layers that collectively engineer the temporal waveform of an input terahertz pulse. Our results demonstrate direct pulse shaping in terahertz spectrum, where the amplitude and phase of the input wavelengths are independently controlled through a passive diffractive device, without the need for an external pump. Furthermore, a physical transfer learning approach is presented to illustrate pulse-width tunability by replacing part of an existing network with newly trained diffractive layers, demonstrating its modularity. This learning-based diffractive pulse engineering framework can find broad applications in e.g., communications, ultra-fast imaging and spectroscopy.		20210104	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33397912

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Dec 22;11(1):6358. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-20215-y.	Impact craters, which can be considered the lunar equivalent of fossils, are the most dominant lunar surface features and record the history of the Solar System. We address the problem of automatic crater detection and age estimation. From initially small numbers of recognized craters and dated craters, i.e., 7895 and 1411, respectively, we progressively identify new craters and estimate their ages with Chang'E data and stratigraphic information by transfer learning using deep neural networks. This results in the identification of 109,956 new craters, which is more than a dozen times greater than the initial number of recognized craters. The formation systems of 18,996 newly detected craters larger than 8 km are estimated. Here, a new lunar crater database for the mid- and low-latitude regions of the Moon is derived and distributed to the planetary community together with the related data analysis.		20201222	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33353954

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Dec 14;11(1):6386. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19712-x.	Eye contact is among the most primary means of social communication used by humans. Quantification of eye contact is valuable as a part of the analysis of social roles and communication skills, and for clinical screening. Estimating a subject's looking direction is a challenging task, but eye contact can be effectively captured by a wearable point-of-view camera which provides a unique viewpoint. While moments of eye contact from this viewpoint can be hand-coded, such a process tends to be laborious and subjective. In this work, we develop a deep neural network model to automatically detect eye contact in egocentric video. It is the first to achieve accuracy equivalent to that of human experts. We train a deep convolutional network using a dataset of 4,339,879 annotated images, consisting of 103 subjects with diverse demographic backgrounds. 57 subjects have a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The network achieves overall precision of 0.936 and recall of 0.943 on 18 validation subjects, and its performance is on par with 10 trained human coders with a mean precision 0.918 and recall 0.946. Our method will be instrumental in gaze behavior analysis by serving as a scalable, objective, and accessible tool for clinicians and researchers.		20201214	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33318484

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Dec 11;11(1):6367. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-20030-5.	Histopathological images are a rich but incompletely explored data type for studying cancer. Manual inspection is time consuming, making it challenging to use for image data mining. Here we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be systematically applied across cancer types, enabling comparisons to reveal shared spatial behaviors. We develop CNN architectures to analyze 27,815 hematoxylin and eosin scanned images from The Cancer Genome Atlas for tumor/normal, cancer subtype, and mutation classification. Our CNNs are able to classify TCGA pathologist-annotated tumor/normal status of whole slide images (WSIs) in 19 cancer types with consistently high AUCs (0.995 +/- 0.008), as well as subtypes with lower but significant accuracy (AUC 0.87 +/- 0.1). Remarkably, tumor/normal CNNs trained on one tissue are effective in others (AUC 0.88 +/- 0.11), with classifier relationships also recapitulating known adenocarcinoma, carcinoma, and developmental biology. Moreover, classifier comparisons reveal intra-slide spatial similarities, with an average tile-level correlation of 0.45 +/- 0.16 between classifier pairs. Breast cancers, bladder cancers, and uterine cancers have spatial patterns that are particularly easy to detect, suggesting these cancers can be canonical types for image analysis. Patterns for TP53 mutations can also be detected, with WSI self- and cross-tissue AUCs ranging from 0.65-0.80. Finally, we comparatively evaluate CNNs on 170 breast and colon cancer images with pathologist-annotated nuclei, finding that both cellular and intercellular regions contribute to CNN accuracy. These results demonstrate the power of CNNs not only for histopathological classification, but also for cross-comparisons to reveal conserved spatial behaviors across tumors.		20201211	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33311458

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Dec 9;11(1):6309. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19693-x.	Analyzing scattered wave to recognize object is of fundamental significance in wave physics. Recently-emerged deep learning technique achieved great success in interpreting wave field such as in ultrasound non-destructive testing and disease diagnosis, but conventionally need time-consuming computer postprocessing or bulky-sized diffractive elements. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a purely-passive and small-footprint meta-neural-network for real-time recognizing complicated objects by analyzing acoustic scattering. We prove meta-neural-network mimics a standard neural network despite its compactness, thanks to unique capability of its metamaterial unit-cells (dubbed meta-neurons) to produce deep-subwavelength phase shift as training parameters. The resulting device exhibits the "intelligence" to perform desired tasks with potential to overcome the current limitations, showcased by two distinctive examples of handwritten digit recognition and discerning misaligned orbital-angular-momentum vortices. Our mechanism opens the route to new metamaterial-based deep-learning paradigms and enable conceptual devices automatically analyzing signals, with far-reaching implications for acoustics and related fields.		20201209	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33298920

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Dec 8;11(1):6280. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19964-7.	Machine learning has the potential to accelerate materials discovery by accurately predicting materials properties at a low computational cost. However, the model inputs remain a key stumbling block. Current methods typically use descriptors constructed from knowledge of either the full crystal structure - therefore only applicable to materials with already characterised structures - or structure-agnostic fixed-length representations hand-engineered from the stoichiometry. We develop a machine learning approach that takes only the stoichiometry as input and automatically learns appropriate and systematically improvable descriptors from data. Our key insight is to treat the stoichiometric formula as a dense weighted graph between elements. Compared to the state of the art for structure-agnostic methods, our approach achieves lower errors with less data.		20201208	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33293567

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Dec 7;11(1):6254. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19863-x.	The invariant development and transparent body of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans enables complete delineation of cell lineages throughout development. Despite extensive studies of cell division, cell migration and cell fate differentiation, cell morphology during development has not yet been systematically characterized in any metazoan, including C. elegans. This knowledge gap substantially hampers many studies in both developmental and cell biology. Here we report an automatic pipeline, CShaper, which combines automated segmentation of fluorescently labeled membranes with automated cell lineage tracing. We apply this pipeline to quantify morphological parameters of densely packed cells in 17 developing C. elegans embryos. Consequently, we generate a time-lapse 3D atlas of cell morphology for the C. elegans embryo from the 4- to 350-cell stages, including cell shape, volume, surface area, migration, nucleus position and cell-cell contact with resolved cell identities. We anticipate that CShaper and the morphological atlas will stimulate and enhance further studies in the fields of developmental biology, cell biology and biomechanics.		20201207	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33288755

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Dec 1;11(1):6151. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19866-8.	Fluorescence microscopy enables spatial and temporal measurements of live cells and cellular communities. However, this potential has not yet been fully realized for investigations of individual cell behaviors and phenotypic changes in dense, three-dimensional (3D) bacterial biofilms. Accurate cell detection and cellular shape measurement in densely packed biofilms are challenging because of the limited resolution and low signal to background ratios (SBRs) in fluorescence microscopy images. In this work, we present Bacterial Cell Morphometry 3D (BCM3D), an image analysis workflow that combines deep learning with mathematical image analysis to accurately segment and classify single bacterial cells in 3D fluorescence images. In BCM3D, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained using simulated biofilm images with experimentally realistic SBRs, cell densities, labeling methods, and cell shapes. We systematically evaluate the segmentation accuracy of BCM3D using both simulated and experimental images. Compared to state-of-the-art bacterial cell segmentation approaches, BCM3D consistently achieves higher segmentation accuracy and further enables automated morphometric cell classifications in multi-population biofilms.		20201201	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33262347

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Dec 1;11(1):6141. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19921-4.	Understanding the genetic regulatory code governing gene expression is an important challenge in molecular biology. However, how individual coding and non-coding regions of the gene regulatory structure interact and contribute to mRNA expression levels remains unclear. Here we apply deep learning on over 20,000 mRNA datasets to examine the genetic regulatory code controlling mRNA abundance in 7 model organisms ranging from bacteria to Human. In all organisms, we can predict mRNA abundance directly from DNA sequence, with up to 82% of the variation of transcript levels encoded in the gene regulatory structure. By searching for DNA regulatory motifs across the gene regulatory structure, we discover that motif interactions could explain the whole dynamic range of mRNA levels. Co-evolution across coding and non-coding regions suggests that it is not single motifs or regions, but the entire gene regulatory structure and specific combination of regulatory elements that define gene expression levels.		20201201	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33262328

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Nov 30;11(1):6090. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19527-w.	Intracranial aneurysm is a common life-threatening disease. Computed tomography angiography is recommended as the standard diagnosis tool; yet, interpretation can be time-consuming and challenging. We present a specific deep-learning-based model trained on 1,177 digital subtraction angiography verified bone-removal computed tomography angiography cases. The model has good tolerance to image quality and is tested with different manufacturers. Simulated real-world studies are conducted in consecutive internal and external cohorts, in which it achieves an improved patient-level sensitivity and lesion-level sensitivity compared to that of radiologists and expert neurosurgeons. A specific cohort of suspected acute ischemic stroke is employed and it is found that 99.0% predicted-negative cases can be trusted with high confidence, leading to a potential reduction in human workload. A prospective study is warranted to determine whether the algorithm could improve patients' care in comparison to clinicians' assessment.		20201130	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33257700

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Nov 26;11(1):6004. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19817-3.	Diagnostic histopathology is a gold standard for diagnosing hematopoietic malignancies. Pathologic diagnosis requires labor-intensive reading of a large number of tissue slides with high diagnostic accuracy equal or close to 100 percent to guide treatment options, but this requirement is difficult to meet. Although artificial intelligence (AI) helps to reduce the labor of reading pathologic slides, diagnostic accuracy has not reached a clinically usable level. Establishment of an AI model often demands big datasets and an ability to handle large variations in sample preparation and image collection. Here, we establish a highly accurate deep learning platform, consisting of multiple convolutional neural networks, to classify pathologic images by using smaller datasets. We analyze human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and non-DLBCL pathologic images from three hospitals separately using AI models, and obtain a diagnostic rate of close to 100 percent (100% for hospital A, 99.71% for hospital B and 100% for hospital C). The technical variability introduced by slide preparation and image collection reduces AI model performance in cross-hospital tests, but the 100% diagnostic accuracy is maintained after its elimination. It is now clinically practical to utilize deep learning models for diagnosis of DLBCL and ultimately other human hematopoietic malignancies.		20201126	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33244018
Zhao, Qingyu; Adeli, Ehsan; Pohl, Kilian M	Training confounder-free deep learning models for medical applications.	Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Nov 26;11(1):6010. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19784-9.	The presence of confounding effects (or biases) is one of the most critical challenges in using deep learning to advance discovery in medical imaging studies. Confounders affect the relationship between input data (e.g., brain MRIs) and output variables (e.g., diagnosis). Improper modeling of those relationships often results in spurious and biased associations. Traditional machine learning and statistical models minimize the impact of confounders by, for example, matching data sets, stratifying data, or residualizing imaging measurements. Alternative strategies are needed for state-of-the-art deep learning models that use end-to-end training to automatically extract informative features from large set of images. In this article, we introduce an end-to-end approach for deriving features invariant to confounding factors while accounting for intrinsic correlations between the confounder(s) and prediction outcome. The method does so by exploiting concepts from traditional statistical methods and recent fair machine learning schemes. We evaluate the method on predicting the diagnosis of HIV solely from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs), identifying morphological sex differences in adolescence from those of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), and determining the bone age from X-ray images of children. The results show that our method can accurately predict while reducing biases associated with confounders.

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Nov 17;11(1):5833. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19673-1.	Traces from single-molecule fluorescence microscopy (SMFM) experiments exhibit photophysical artifacts that typically necessitate human expert screening, which is time-consuming and introduces potential for user-dependent expectation bias. Here, we use deep learning to develop a rapid, automatic SMFM trace selector, termed AutoSiM, that improves the sensitivity and specificity of an assay for a DNA point mutation based on single-molecule recognition through equilibrium Poisson sampling (SiMREPS). The improved performance of AutoSiM is based on accepting both more true positives and fewer false positives than the conventional approach of hidden Markov modeling (HMM) followed by hard thresholding. As a second application, the selector is used for automated screening of single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) data to identify high-quality traces for further analysis, and achieves ~90% concordance with manual selection while requiring less processing time. Finally, we show that AutoSiM can be adapted readily to novel datasets, requiring only modest Transfer Learning.		20201117	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33203879

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Nov 16;11(1):5727. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19334-3.	For newly diagnosed breast cancer, estrogen receptor status (ERS) is a key molecular marker used for prognosis and treatment decisions. During clinical management, ERS is determined by pathologists from immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of biopsied tissue for the targeted receptor, which highlights the presence of cellular surface antigens. This is an expensive, time-consuming process which introduces discordance in results due to variability in IHC preparation and pathologist subjectivity. In contrast, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining-which highlights cellular morphology-is quick, less expensive, and less variable in preparation. Here we show that machine learning can determine molecular marker status, as assessed by hormone receptors, directly from cellular morphology. We develop a multiple instance learning-based deep neural network that determines ERS from H&E-stained whole slide images (WSI). Our algorithm-trained strictly with WSI-level annotations-is accurate on a varied, multi-country dataset of 3,474 patients, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 for sensitivity and specificity. Our approach has the potential to augment clinicians' capabilities in cancer prognosis and theragnosis by harnessing biological signals imperceptible to the human eye.		20201116	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33199723

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Nov 6;11(1):5626. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19449-7.	Whole-body imaging of mice is a key source of information for research. Organ segmentation is a prerequisite for quantitative analysis but is a tedious and error-prone task if done manually. Here, we present a deep learning solution called AIMOS that automatically segments major organs (brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, bladder, stomach, intestine) and the skeleton in less than a second, orders of magnitude faster than prior algorithms. AIMOS matches or exceeds the segmentation quality of state-of-the-art approaches and of human experts. We exemplify direct applicability for biomedical research for localizing cancer metastases. Furthermore, we show that expert annotations are subject to human error and bias. As a consequence, we show that at least two independently created annotations are needed to assess model performance. Importantly, AIMOS addresses the issue of human bias by identifying the regions where humans are most likely to disagree, and thereby localizes and quantifies this uncertainty for improved downstream analysis. In summary, AIMOS is a powerful open-source tool to increase scalability, reduce bias, and foster reproducibility in many areas of biomedical research.		20201106	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33159057
Thiagarajan, Jayaraman J; Venkatesh, Bindya; Anirudh, Rushil; Bremer, Peer-Timo; Gaffney, Jim; Anderson, Gemma; Spears, Brian	Designing accurate emulators for scientific processes using calibration-driven deep models.	Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Nov 6;11(1):5622. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19448-8.	Predictive models that accurately emulate complex scientific processes can achieve speed-ups over numerical simulators or experiments and at the same time provide surrogates for improving the subsequent analysis. Consequently, there is a recent surge in utilizing modern machine learning methods to build data-driven emulators. In this work, we study an often overlooked, yet important, problem of choosing loss functions while designing such emulators. Popular choices such as the mean squared error or the mean absolute error are based on a symmetric noise assumption and can be unsuitable for heterogeneous data or asymmetric noise distributions. We propose Learn-by-Calibrating, a novel deep learning approach based on interval calibration for designing emulators that can effectively recover the inherent noise structure without any explicit priors. Using a large suite of use-cases, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in providing high-quality emulators, when compared to widely-adopted loss function choices, even in small-data regimes.		20201106	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33159053
Seddiki, Khawla; Saudemont, Philippe; Precioso, Frederic; Ogrinc, Nina; Wisztorski, Maxence; Salzet, Michel; Fournier, Isabelle; Droit, Arnaud	Cumulative learning enables convolutional neural network representations for small mass spectrometry data classification.	Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Nov 5;11(1):5595. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19354-z.	Rapid and accurate clinical diagnosis remains challenging. A component of diagnosis tool development is the design of effective classification models with Mass spectrometry (MS) data. Some Machine Learning approaches have been investigated but these models require time-consuming preprocessing steps to remove artifacts, making them unsuitable for rapid analysis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been found to perform well under such circumstances since they can learn representations from raw data. However, their effectiveness decreases when the number of available training samples is small, which is a common situation in medicine. In this work, we investigate transfer learning on 1D-CNNs, then we develop a cumulative learning method when transfer learning is not powerful enough. We propose to train the same model through several classification tasks over various small datasets to accumulate knowledge in the resulting representation. By using rat brain as the initial training dataset, a cumulative learning approach can have a classification accuracy exceeding 98% for 1D clinical MS-data. We show the use of cumulative learning using datasets generated in different biological contexts, on different organisms, and acquired by different instruments. Here we show a promising strategy for improving MS data classification accuracy when only small numbers of samples are available.		20201105	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33154370
Manuylovich, Egor S; Dvoyrin, Vladislav V; Turitsyn, Sergei K	Fast mode decomposition in few-mode fibers.	Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Nov 2;11(1):5507. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19323-6.	Retrieval of the optical phase information from measurement of intensity is of a high interest because this would facilitate simple and cost-efficient techniques and devices. In scientific and industrial applications that exploit multi-mode fibers, a prior knowledge of spatial mode structure of the fiber, in principle, makes it possible to recover phases using measured intensity distribution. However, current mode decomposition algorithms based on the analysis of the intensity distribution at the output of a few-mode fiber, such as optimization methods or neural networks, still have high computational costs and high latency that is a serious impediment for applications, such as telecommunications. Speed of signal processing is one of the key challenges in this approach. We present a high-performance mode decomposition algorithm with a processing time of tens of microseconds. The proposed mathematical algorithm that does not use any machine learning techniques, is several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art deep-learning-based methods. We anticipate that our results can stimulate further research on algorithms beyond popular machine learning methods and they can lead to the development of low-cost phase retrieval receivers for various applications of few-mode fibers ranging from imaging to telecommunications.		20201102	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33139691
Battleday, Ruairidh M; Peterson, Joshua C; Griffiths, Thomas L	Capturing human categorization of natural images by combining deep networks and cognitive models.	Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Oct 27;11(1):5418. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18946-z.	Human categorization is one of the most important and successful targets of cognitive modeling, with decades of model development and assessment using simple, low-dimensional artificial stimuli. However, it remains unclear how these findings relate to categorization in more natural settings, involving complex, high-dimensional stimuli. Here, we take a step towards addressing this question by modeling human categorization over a large behavioral dataset, comprising more than 500,000 judgments over 10,000 natural images from ten object categories. We apply a range of machine learning methods to generate candidate representations for these images, and show that combining rich image representations with flexible cognitive models captures human decisions best. We also find that in the high-dimensional representational spaces these methods generate, simple prototype models can perform comparably to the more complex memory-based exemplar models dominant in laboratory settings.		20201027	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33110085
Lim, Kevin; Pan, Kun; Yu, Zhe; Xiao, Rong Hui	Pattern recognition based on machine learning identifies oil adulteration and edible oil mixtures.	Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Oct 23;11(1):5353. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19137-6.	Previous studies have shown that each edible oil type has its own characteristic fatty acid profile; however, no method has yet been described allowing the identification of oil types simply based on this characteristic. Moreover, the fatty acid profile of a specific oil type can be mimicked by a mixture of 2 or more oil types. This has led to fraudulent oil adulteration and intentional mislabeling of edible oils threatening food safety and endangering public health. Here, we present a machine learning method to uncover fatty acid patterns discriminative for ten different plant oil types and their intra-variability. We also describe a supervised end-to-end learning method that can be generalized to oil composition of any given mixtures. Trained on a large number of simulated oil mixtures, independent test dataset validation demonstrates that the model has a 50(th) percentile absolute error between 1.4-1.8% and a 90(th) percentile error of 4-5.4% for any 3-way mixtures of the ten oil types. The deep learning model can also be further refined with on-line training. Because oil-producing plants have diverse geographical origins and hence slightly varying fatty acid profiles, an online-training method provides also a way to capture useful knowledge presently unavailable. Our method allows the ability to control product quality, determining the fair price of purchased oils and in-turn allowing health-conscious consumers the future of accurate labeling.		20201023	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33097723
Norris, Barnaby R M; Wei, Jin; Betters, Christopher H; Wong, Alison; Leon-Saval, Sergio G	An all-photonic focal-plane wavefront sensor.	Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Oct 21;11(1):5335. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19117-w.	Adaptive optics (AO) is critical in astronomy, optical communications and remote sensing to deal with the rapid blurring caused by the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. But current AO systems are limited by their wavefront sensors, which need to be in an optical plane non-common to the science image and are insensitive to certain wavefront-error modes. Here we present a wavefront sensor based on a photonic lantern fibre-mode-converter and deep learning, which can be placed at the same focal plane as the science image, and is optimal for single-mode fibre injection. By measuring the intensities of an array of single-mode outputs, both phase and amplitude information on the incident wavefront can be reconstructed. We demonstrate the concept with simulations and an experimental realisation wherein Zernike wavefront errors are recovered from focal-plane measurements to a precision of 5.1 x 10(-3) pi radians root-mean-squared-error.		20201021	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33087712

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Oct 20;11(1):5316. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19105-0.	A comparative analysis of animal behavior (e.g., male vs. female groups) has been widely used to elucidate behavior specific to one group since pre-Darwinian times. However, big data generated by new sensing technologies, e.g., GPS, makes it difficult for them to contrast group differences manually. This study introduces DeepHL, a deep learning-assisted platform for the comparative analysis of animal movement data, i.e., trajectories. This software uses a deep neural network based on an attention mechanism to automatically detect segments in trajectories that are characteristic of one group. It then highlights these segments in visualized trajectories, enabling biologists to focus on these segments, and helps them reveal the underlying meaning of the highlighted segments to facilitate formulating new hypotheses. We tested the platform on a variety of trajectories of worms, insects, mice, bears, and seabirds across a scale from millimeters to hundreds of kilometers, revealing new movement features of these animals.		20201020	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33082335

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Oct 16;11(1):5228. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19116-x.	Two major treatment strategies employed in non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC, are tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKIs, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, ICIs. The choice of strategy is based on heterogeneous biomarkers that can dynamically change during therapy. Thus, there is a compelling need to identify comprehensive biomarkers that can be used longitudinally to help guide therapy choice. Herein, we report a (18)F-FDG-PET/CT-based deep learning model, which demonstrates high accuracy in EGFR mutation status prediction across patient cohorts from different institutions. A deep learning score (EGFR-DLS) was significantly and positively associated with longer progression free survival (PFS) in patients treated with EGFR-TKIs, while EGFR-DLS is significantly and negatively associated with higher durable clinical benefit, reduced hyperprogression, and longer PFS among patients treated with ICIs. Thus, the EGFR-DLS provides a non-invasive method for precise quantification of EGFR mutation status in NSCLC patients, which is promising to identify NSCLC patients sensitive to EGFR-TKI or ICI-treatments.		20201016	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33067442
Bepler, Tristan; Kelley, Kotaro; Noble, Alex J; Berger, Bonnie	Topaz-Denoise: general deep denoising models for cryoEM and cryoET.	Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Oct 15;11(1):5208. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18952-1.	Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is becoming the preferred method for resolving protein structures. Low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in cryoEM images reduces the confidence and throughput of structure determination during several steps of data processing, resulting in impediments such as missing particle orientations. Denoising cryoEM images can not only improve downstream analysis but also accelerate the time-consuming data collection process by allowing lower electron dose micrographs to be used for analysis. Here, we present Topaz-Denoise, a deep learning method for reliably and rapidly increasing the SNR of cryoEM images and cryoET tomograms. By training on a dataset composed of thousands of micrographs collected across a wide range of imaging conditions, we are able to learn models capturing the complexity of the cryoEM image formation process. The general model we present is able to denoise new datasets without additional training. Denoising with this model improves micrograph interpretability and allows us to solve 3D single particle structures of clustered protocadherin, an elongated particle with previously elusive views. We then show that low dose collection, enabled by Topaz-Denoise, improves downstream analysis in addition to reducing data collection time. We also present a general 3D denoising model for cryoET. Topaz-Denoise and pre-trained general models are now included in Topaz. We expect that Topaz-Denoise will be of broad utility to the cryoEM community for improving micrograph and tomogram interpretability and accelerating analysis.		20201015	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33060581
Gao, Yan; Cui, Yan	Deep transfer learning for reducing health care disparities arising from biomedical data inequality.	Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Oct 12;11(1):5131. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18918-3.	As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied to biomedical research and clinical decisions, developing unbiased AI models that work equally well for all ethnic groups is of crucial importance to health disparity prevention and reduction. However, the biomedical data inequality between different ethnic groups is set to generate new health care disparities through data-driven, algorithm-based biomedical research and clinical decisions. Using an extensive set of machine learning experiments on cancer omics data, we find that current prevalent schemes of multiethnic machine learning are prone to generating significant model performance disparities between ethnic groups. We show that these performance disparities are caused by data inequality and data distribution discrepancies between ethnic groups. We also find that transfer learning can improve machine learning model performance for data-disadvantaged ethnic groups, and thus provides an effective approach to reduce health care disparities arising from data inequality among ethnic groups.		20201012	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33046699

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Oct 9;11(1):5088. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18685-1.	Early detection of COVID-19 based on chest CT enables timely treatment of patients and helps control the spread of the disease. We proposed an artificial intelligence (AI) system for rapid COVID-19 detection and performed extensive statistical analysis of CTs of COVID-19 based on the AI system. We developed and evaluated our system on a large dataset with more than 10 thousand CT volumes from COVID-19, influenza-A/B, non-viral community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and non-pneumonia subjects. In such a difficult multi-class diagnosis task, our deep convolutional neural network-based system is able to achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 97.81% for multi-way classification on test cohort of 3,199 scans, AUC of 92.99% and 93.25% on two publicly available datasets, CC-CCII and MosMedData respectively. In a reader study involving five radiologists, the AI system outperforms all of radiologists in more challenging tasks at a speed of two orders of magnitude above them. Diagnosis performance of chest x-ray (CXR) is compared to that of CT. Detailed interpretation of deep network is also performed to relate system outputs with CT presentations.

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Oct 7;11(1):5058. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18676-2.	While synthetic biology has revolutionized our approaches to medicine, agriculture, and energy, the design of completely novel biological circuit components beyond naturally-derived templates remains challenging due to poorly understood design rules. Toehold switches, which are programmable nucleic acid sensors, face an analogous design bottleneck; our limited understanding of how sequence impacts functionality often necessitates expensive, time-consuming screens to identify effective switches. Here, we introduce Sequence-based Toehold Optimization and Redesign Model (STORM) and Nucleic-Acid Speech (NuSpeak), two orthogonal and synergistic deep learning architectures to characterize and optimize toeholds. Applying techniques from computer vision and natural language processing, we 'un-box' our models using convolutional filters, attention maps, and in silico mutagenesis. Through transfer-learning, we redesign sub-optimal toehold sensors, even with sparse training data, experimentally validating their improved performance. This work provides sequence-to-function deep learning frameworks for toehold selection and design, augmenting our ability to construct potent biological circuit components and precision diagnostics.		20201007	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33028819

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Oct 7;11(1):5046. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18823-9.	Signal loss in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional neuroimaging is common and can lead to misinterpretation of findings. Here, we reconstructed compromised fMRI signal using deep machine learning. We trained a model to learn principles governing BOLD activity in one dataset and reconstruct artificially compromised regions in an independent dataset, frame by frame. Intriguingly, BOLD time series extracted from reconstructed frames are correlated with the original time series, even though the frames do not independently carry any temporal information. Moreover, reconstructed functional connectivity maps exhibit good correspondence with the original connectivity maps, indicating that the model recovers functional relationships among brain regions. We replicated this result in two healthy datasets and in patients whose scans suffered signal loss due to intracortical electrodes. Critically, the reconstructions capture individual-specific information. Deep machine learning thus presents a unique opportunity to reconstruct compromised BOLD signal while capturing features of an individual's own functional brain organization.		20201007	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33028816

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Oct 7;11(1):5057. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18677-1.	Engineered RNA elements are programmable tools capable of detecting small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. Predicting the behavior of these synthetic biology components remains a challenge, a situation that could be addressed through enhanced pattern recognition from deep learning. Here, we investigate Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to predict toehold switch function as a canonical riboswitch model in synthetic biology. To facilitate DNN training, we synthesize and characterize in vivo a dataset of 91,534 toehold switches spanning 23 viral genomes and 906 human transcription factors. DNNs trained on nucleotide sequences outperform (R(2) = 0.43-0.70) previous state-of-the-art thermodynamic and kinetic models (R(2) = 0.04-0.15) and allow for human-understandable attention-visualizations (VIS4Map) to identify success and failure modes. This work shows that deep learning approaches can be used for functionality predictions and insight generation in RNA synthetic biology.		20201007	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33028812

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Sep 25;11(1):4874. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18671-7.	Organic synthesis methodology enables the synthesis of complex molecules and materials used in all fields of science and technology and represents a vast body of accumulated knowledge optimally suited for deep learning. While most organic reactions involve distinct functional groups and can readily be learned by deep learning models and chemists alike, regio- and stereoselective transformations are more challenging because their outcome also depends on functional group surroundings. Here, we challenge the Molecular Transformer model to predict reactions on carbohydrates where regio- and stereoselectivity are notoriously difficult to predict. We show that transfer learning of the general patent reaction model with a small set of carbohydrate reactions produces a specialized model returning predictions for carbohydrate reactions with remarkable accuracy. We validate these predictions experimentally with the synthesis of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide involving regioselective protections and stereoselective glycosylations. The transfer learning approach should be applicable to any reaction class of interest.		20200925	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32978395

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Sep 17;11(1):4703. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18515-4.	Deep learning models have shown great promise in predicting regulatory effects from DNA sequence, but their informativeness for human complex diseases is not fully understood. Here, we evaluate genome-wide SNP annotations from two previous deep learning models, DeepSEA and Basenji, by applying stratified LD score regression to 41 diseases and traits (average N = 320K), conditioning on a broad set of coding, conserved and regulatory annotations. We aggregated annotations across all (respectively blood or brain) tissues/cell-types in meta-analyses across all (respectively 11 blood or 8 brain) traits. The annotations were highly enriched for disease heritability, but produced only limited conditionally significant results: non-tissue-specific and brain-specific Basenji-H3K4me3 for all traits and brain traits respectively. We conclude that deep learning models have yet to achieve their full potential to provide considerable unique information for complex disease, and that their conditional informativeness for disease cannot be inferred from their accuracy in predicting regulatory annotations.		20200917	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32943643

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Sep 14;11(1):4609. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18471-z.	Toward smart building and smart home, floor as one of our most frequently interactive interfaces can be implemented with embedded sensors to extract abundant sensory information without the video-taken concerns. Yet the previously developed floor sensors are normally of small scale, high implementation cost, large power consumption, and complicated device configuration. Here we show a smart floor monitoring system through the integration of self-powered triboelectric floor mats and deep learning-based data analytics. The floor mats are fabricated with unique "identity" electrode patterns using a low-cost and highly scalable screen printing technique, enabling a parallel connection to reduce the system complexity and the deep-learning computational cost. The stepping position, activity status, and identity information can be determined according to the instant sensory data analytics. This developed smart floor technology can establish the foundation using floor as the functional interface for diverse applications in smart building/home, e.g., intelligent automation, healthcare, and security.		20200914	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32929087

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Sep 11;11(1):4560. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18441-5.	The rhesus macaque is an important model species in several branches of science, including neuroscience, psychology, ethology, and medicine. The utility of the macaque model would be greatly enhanced by the ability to precisely measure behavior in freely moving conditions. Existing approaches do not provide sufficient tracking. Here, we describe OpenMonkeyStudio, a deep learning-based markerless motion capture system for estimating 3D pose in freely moving macaques in large unconstrained environments. Our system makes use of 62 machine vision cameras that encircle an open 2.45 m x 2.45 m x 2.75 m enclosure. The resulting multiview image streams allow for data augmentation via 3D-reconstruction of annotated images to train a robust view-invariant deep neural network. This view invariance represents an important advance over previous markerless 2D tracking approaches, and allows fully automatic pose inference on unconstrained natural motion. We show that OpenMonkeyStudio can be used to accurately recognize actions and track social interactions.		20200911	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32917899

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Sep 1;11(1):4391. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18197-y.	Deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks has shown great promise in image-based classification and enhancement but is often unsuitable for predictive modeling using features without spatial correlations. We present a feature representation approach termed REFINED (REpresentation of Features as Images with NEighborhood Dependencies) to arrange high-dimensional vectors in a compact image form conducible for CNN-based deep learning. We consider the similarities between features to generate a concise feature map in the form of a two-dimensional image by minimizing the pairwise distance values following a Bayesian Metric Multidimensional Scaling Approach. We hypothesize that this approach enables embedded feature extraction and, integrated with CNN-based deep learning, can boost the predictive accuracy. We illustrate the superior predictive capabilities of the proposed framework as compared to state-of-the-art methodologies in drug sensitivity prediction scenarios using synthetic datasets, drug chemical descriptors as predictors from NCI60, and both transcriptomic information and drug descriptors as predictors from GDSC.		20200901	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32873806

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Sep 1;11(1):4381. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18073-9.	The quality of human translation was long thought to be unattainable for computer translation systems. In this study, we present a deep-learning system, CUBBITT, which challenges this view. In a context-aware blind evaluation by human judges, CUBBITT significantly outperformed professional-agency English-to-Czech news translation in preserving text meaning (translation adequacy). While human translation is still rated as more fluent, CUBBITT is shown to be substantially more fluent than previous state-of-the-art systems. Moreover, most participants of a Translation Turing test struggle to distinguish CUBBITT translations from human translations. This work approaches the quality of human translation and even surpasses it in adequacy in certain circumstances.This suggests that deep learning may have the potential to replace humans in applications where conservation of meaning is the primary aim.		20200901	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32873773

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Aug 27;11(1):4294. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18147-8.	The early detection and accurate histopathological diagnosis of gastric cancer increase the chances of successful treatment. The worldwide shortage of pathologists offers a unique opportunity for the use of artificial intelligence assistance systems to alleviate the workload and increase diagnostic accuracy. Here, we report a clinically applicable system developed at the Chinese PLA General Hospital, China, using a deep convolutional neural network trained with 2,123 pixel-level annotated H&E-stained whole slide images. The model achieves a sensitivity near 100% and an average specificity of 80.6% on a real-world test dataset with 3,212 whole slide images digitalized by three scanners. We show that the system could aid pathologists in improving diagnostic accuracy and preventing misdiagnoses. Moreover, we demonstrate that our system performs robustly with 1,582 whole slide images from two other medical centres. Our study suggests the feasibility and benefits of using histopathological artificial intelligence assistance systems in routine practice scenarios.		20200827	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32855423

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Aug 25;11(1):4238. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-18037-z.	Recently, deep learning has unlocked unprecedented success in various domains, especially using images, text, and speech. However, deep learning is only beneficial if the data have nonlinear relationships and if they are exploitable at available sample sizes. We systematically profiled the performance of deep, kernel, and linear models as a function of sample size on UKBiobank brain images against established machine learning references. On MNIST and Zalando Fashion, prediction accuracy consistently improves when escalating from linear models to shallow-nonlinear models, and further improves with deep-nonlinear models. In contrast, using structural or functional brain scans, simple linear models perform on par with more complex, highly parameterized models in age/sex prediction across increasing sample sizes. In sum, linear models keep improving as the sample size approaches ~10,000 subjects. Yet, nonlinearities for predicting common phenotypes from typical brain scans remain largely inaccessible to the examined kernel and deep learning methods.		20200825	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32843633

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Aug 14;11(1):4080. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-17971-2.	Chest CT is emerging as a valuable diagnostic tool for clinical management of COVID-19 associated lung disease. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to aid in rapid evaluation of CT scans for differentiation of COVID-19 findings from other clinical entities. Here we show that a series of deep learning algorithms, trained in a diverse multinational cohort of 1280 patients to localize parietal pleura/lung parenchyma followed by classification of COVID-19 pneumonia, can achieve up to 90.8% accuracy, with 84% sensitivity and 93% specificity, as evaluated in an independent test set (not included in training and validation) of 1337 patients. Normal controls included chest CTs from oncology, emergency, and pneumonia-related indications. The false positive rate in 140 patients with laboratory confirmed other (non COVID-19) pneumonias was 10%. AI-based algorithms can readily identify CT scans with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, as well as distinguish non-COVID related pneumonias with high specificity in diverse patient populations.		20200814	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32796848

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Aug 13;11(1):4054. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-17807-z.	Many neurological and musculoskeletal diseases impair movement, which limits people's function and social participation. Quantitative assessment of motion is critical to medical decision-making but is currently possible only with expensive motion capture systems and highly trained personnel. Here, we present a method for predicting clinically relevant motion parameters from an ordinary video of a patient. Our machine learning models predict parameters include walking speed (r = 0.73), cadence (r = 0.79), knee flexion angle at maximum extension (r = 0.83), and Gait Deviation Index (GDI), a comprehensive metric of gait impairment (r = 0.75). These correlation values approach the theoretical limits for accuracy imposed by natural variability in these metrics within our patient population. Our methods for quantifying gait pathology with commodity cameras increase access to quantitative motion analysis in clinics and at home and enable researchers to conduct large-scale studies of neurological and musculoskeletal disorders.		20200813	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32792511
Mousavi, S Mostafa; Ellsworth, William L; Zhu, Weiqiang; Chuang, Lindsay Y; Beroza, Gregory C	Earthquake transformer-an attentive deep-learning model for simultaneous earthquake detection and phase picking.	Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Aug 7;11(1):3952. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-17591-w.	Earthquake signal detection and seismic phase picking are challenging tasks in the processing of noisy data and the monitoring of microearthquakes. Here we present a global deep-learning model for simultaneous earthquake detection and phase picking. Performing these two related tasks in tandem improves model performance in each individual task by combining information in phases and in the full waveform of earthquake signals by using a hierarchical attention mechanism. We show that our model outperforms previous deep-learning and traditional phase-picking and detection algorithms. Applying our model to 5 weeks of continuous data recorded during 2000 Tottori earthquakes in Japan, we were able to detect and locate two times more earthquakes using only a portion (less than 1/3) of seismic stations. Our model picks P and S phases with precision close to manual picks by human analysts; however, its high efficiency and higher sensitivity can result in detecting and characterizing more and smaller events.		20200807	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32770023

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Aug 7;11(1):3972. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-17841-x.	The continuously growing amount of seismic data collected worldwide is outpacing our abilities for analysis, since to date, such datasets have been analyzed in a human-expert-intensive, supervised fashion. Moreover, analyses that are conducted can be strongly biased by the standard models employed by seismologists. In response to both of these challenges, we develop a new unsupervised machine learning framework for detecting and clustering seismic signals in continuous seismic records. Our approach combines a deep scattering network and a Gaussian mixture model to cluster seismic signal segments and detect novel structures. To illustrate the power of the framework, we analyze seismic data acquired during the June 2017 Nuugaatsiaq, Greenland landslide. We demonstrate the blind detection and recovery of the repeating precursory seismicity that was recorded before the main landslide rupture, which suggests that our approach could lead to more informative forecasting of the seismic activity in seismogenic areas.		20200807	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769972

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Aug 3;11(1):3877. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-17678-4.	Deep learning methods for digital pathology analysis are an effective way to address multiple clinical questions, from diagnosis to prediction of treatment outcomes. These methods have also been used to predict gene mutations from pathology images, but no comprehensive evaluation of their potential for extracting molecular features from histology slides has yet been performed. We show that HE2RNA, a model based on the integration of multiple data modes, can be trained to systematically predict RNA-Seq profiles from whole-slide images alone, without expert annotation. Through its interpretable design, HE2RNA provides virtual spatialization of gene expression, as validated by CD3- and CD20-staining on an independent dataset. The transcriptomic representation learned by HE2RNA can also be transferred on other datasets, even of small size, to increase prediction performance for specific molecular phenotypes. We illustrate the use of this approach in clinical diagnosis purposes such as the identification of tumors with microsatellite instability.		20200803	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32747659

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Jul 23;11(1):3694. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-17516-7.	In long-haul optical communication systems, compensating nonlinear effects through digital signal processing (DSP) is difficult due to intractable interactions between Kerr nonlinearity, chromatic dispersion (CD) and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise from inline amplifiers. Optimizing the standard digital back propagation (DBP) as a deep neural network (DNN) with interleaving linear and nonlinear operations for fiber nonlinearity compensation was shown to improve transmission performance in idealized simulation environments. Here, we extend such concepts to practical single-channel and polarization division multiplexed wavelength division multiplexed experiments. We show improved performance compared to state-of-the-art DSP algorithms and additionally, the optimized DNN-based DBP parameters exhibit a mathematical structure which guides us to further analyze the noise statistics of fiber nonlinearity compensation. This machine learning-inspired analysis reveals that ASE noise and incomplete CD compensation of the Kerr nonlinear term produce extra distortions that accumulates along the DBP stages. Therefore, the best DSP should balance between suppressing these distortions and inverting the fiber propagation effects, and such trade-off shifts across different DBP stages in a quantifiable manner. Instead of the common 'black-box' approach to intractable problems, our work shows how machine learning can be a complementary tool to human analytical thinking and help advance theoretical understandings in disciplines such as optics.		20200723	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32703945

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Jul 17;11(1):3601. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-17266-6.	Experimental procedures for chemical synthesis are commonly reported in prose in patents or in the scientific literature. The extraction of the details necessary to reproduce and validate a synthesis in a chemical laboratory is often a tedious task requiring extensive human intervention. We present a method to convert unstructured experimental procedures written in English to structured synthetic steps (action sequences) reflecting all the operations needed to successfully conduct the corresponding chemical reactions. To achieve this, we design a set of synthesis actions with predefined properties and a deep-learning sequence to sequence model based on the transformer architecture to convert experimental procedures to action sequences. The model is pretrained on vast amounts of data generated automatically with a custom rule-based natural language processing approach and refined on manually annotated samples. Predictions on our test set result in a perfect (100%) match of the action sequence for 60.8% of sentences, a 90% match for 71.3% of sentences, and a 75% match for 82.4% of sentences.		20200717	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32681088

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Jul 17;11(1):3625. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-17236-y.	Recurrently connected networks of spiking neurons underlie the astounding information processing capabilities of the brain. Yet in spite of extensive research, how they can learn through synaptic plasticity to carry out complex network computations remains unclear. We argue that two pieces of this puzzle were provided by experimental data from neuroscience. A mathematical result tells us how these pieces need to be combined to enable biologically plausible online network learning through gradient descent, in particular deep reinforcement learning. This learning method-called e-prop-approaches the performance of backpropagation through time (BPTT), the best-known method for training recurrent neural networks in machine learning. In addition, it suggests a method for powerful on-chip learning in energy-efficient spike-based hardware for artificial intelligence.		20200717	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32681001

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Jul 15;11(1):3551. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-17222-4.	Predicting effects of gene regulatory elements (GREs) is a longstanding challenge in biology. Machine learning may address this, but requires large datasets linking GREs to their quantitative function. However, experimental methods to generate such datasets are either application-specific or technically complex and error-prone. Here, we introduce DNA-based phenotypic recording as a widely applicable, practicable approach to generate large-scale sequence-function datasets. We use a site-specific recombinase to directly record a GRE's effect in DNA, enabling readout of both sequence and quantitative function for extremely large GRE-sets via next-generation sequencing. We record translation kinetics of over 300,000 bacterial ribosome binding sites (RBSs) in >2.7 million sequence-function pairs in a single experiment. Further, we introduce a deep learning approach employing ensembling and uncertainty modelling that predicts RBS function with high accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. DNA-based phenotypic recording combined with deep learning represents a major advance in our ability to predict function from genetic sequence.		20200715	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32669542

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Jul 15;11(1):3543. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-17280-8.	The sudden deterioration of patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) into critical illness is of major concern. It is imperative to identify these patients early. We show that a deep learning-based survival model can predict the risk of COVID-19 patients developing critical illness based on clinical characteristics at admission. We develop this model using a cohort of 1590 patients from 575 medical centers, with internal validation performance of concordance index 0.894 We further validate the model on three separate cohorts from Wuhan, Hubei and Guangdong provinces consisting of 1393 patients with concordance indexes of 0.890, 0.852 and 0.967 respectively. This model is used to create an online calculation tool designed for patient triage at admission to identify patients at risk of severe illness, ensuring that patients at greatest risk of severe illness receive appropriate care as early as possible and allow for effective allocation of health resources.		20200715	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32669540

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Jul 13;11(1):3488. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-17155-y.	In recent years, numerous applications have demonstrated the potential of deep learning for an improved understanding of biological processes. However, most deep learning tools developed so far are designed to address a specific question on a fixed dataset and/or by a fixed model architecture. Here we present Janggu, a python library facilitates deep learning for genomics applications, aiming to ease data acquisition and model evaluation. Among its key features are special dataset objects, which form a unified and flexible data acquisition and pre-processing framework for genomics data that enables streamlining of future research applications through reusable components. Through a numpy-like interface, these dataset objects are directly compatible with popular deep learning libraries, including keras or pytorch. Janggu offers the possibility to visualize predictions as genomic tracks or by exporting them to the bigWig format as well as utilities for keras-based models. We illustrate the functionality of Janggu on several deep learning genomics applications. First, we evaluate different model topologies for the task of predicting binding sites for the transcription factor JunD. Second, we demonstrate the framework on published models for predicting chromatin effects. Third, we show that promoter usage measured by CAGE can be predicted using DNase hypersensitivity, histone modifications and DNA sequence features. We improve the performance of these models due to a novel feature in Janggu that allows us to include high-order sequence features. We believe that Janggu will help to significantly reduce repetitive programming overhead for deep learning applications in genomics, and will enable computational biologists to rapidly assess biological hypotheses.		20200713	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32661261

Recent advances in nanomaterials and nano-microfabrication have enabled the development of flexible wearable electronics. However, existing manufacturing methods still rely on a multi-step, error-prone complex process that requires a costly cleanroom facility. Here, we report a new class of additive nanomanufacturing of functional materials that enables a wireless, multilayered, seamlessly interconnected, and flexible hybrid electronic system. All-printed electronics, incorporating machine learning, offers multi-class and versatile human-machine interfaces. One of the key technological advancements is the use of a functionalized conductive graphene with enhanced biocompatibility, anti-oxidation, and solderability, which allows a wireless flexible circuit. The high-aspect ratio graphene offers gel-free, high-fidelity recording of muscle activities. The performance of the printed electronics is demonstrated by using real-time control of external systems via electromyograms. Anatomical study with deep learning-embedded electrophysiology mapping allows for an optimal selection of three channels to capture all finger motions with an accuracy of about 99% for seven classes.		20200710	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32651424

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Jul 3;11(1):3311. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-17123-6.	Geoscientists mainly identify subsurface geologic features using exploration-derived seismic data. Classification or segmentation of 2D/3D seismic images commonly relies on conventional deep learning methods for image recognition. However, complex reflections of seismic waves tend to form high-dimensional and multi-scale signals, making traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) computationally costly. Here we propose a highly efficient and resource-saving CNN architecture (SeismicPatchNet) with topological modules and multi-scale-feature fusion units for classifying seismic data, which was discovered by an automated data-driven search strategy. The storage volume of the architecture parameters (0.73 M) is only ~2.7 MB, ~0.5% of the well-known VGG-16 architecture. SeismicPatchNet predicts nearly 18 times faster than ResNet-50 and shows an overwhelming advantage in identifying Bottom Simulating Reflection (BSR), an indicator of marine gas-hydrate resources. Saliency mapping demonstrated that our architecture captured key features well. These results suggest the prospect of end-to-end interpretation of multiple seismic datasets at extremely low computational cost.		20200703	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32620867

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Jun 25;11(1):3211. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-16985-0.	Shallow feed-forward networks are incapable of addressing complex tasks such as natural language processing that require learning of temporal signals. To address these requirements, we need deep neuromorphic architectures with recurrent connections such as deep recurrent neural networks. However, the training of such networks demand very high precision of weights, excellent conductance linearity and low write-noise- not satisfied by current memristive implementations. Inspired from optogenetics, here we report a neuromorphic computing platform comprised of photo-excitable neuristors capable of in-memory computations across 980 addressable states with a high signal-to-noise ratio of 77. The large linear dynamic range, low write noise and selective excitability allows high fidelity opto-electronic transfer of weights with a two-shot write scheme, while electrical in-memory inference provides energy efficiency. This method enables implementing a memristive deep recurrent neural network with twelve trainable layers with more than a million parameters to recognize spoken commands with >90% accuracy.		20200625	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32587241

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Jun 11;11(1):2961. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-16777-6.	Colonoscopy is commonly used to screen for colorectal cancer (CRC). We develop a deep learning model called CRCNet for optical diagnosis of CRC by training on 464,105 images from 12,179 patients and test its performance on 2263 patients from three independent datasets. At the patient-level, CRCNet achieves an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.882 (95% CI: 0.828-0.931), 0.874 (0.820-0.926) and 0.867 (0.795-0.923). CRCNet exceeds average endoscopists performance on recall rate across two test sets (91.3% versus 83.8%; two-sided t-test, p < 0.001 and 96.5% versus 90.3%; p = 0.006) and precision for one test set (93.7% versus 83.8%; p = 0.02), while obtains comparable recall rate on one test set and precision on the other two. At the image-level, CRCNet achieves an AUPRC of 0.990 (0.987-0.993), 0.991 (0.987-0.995), and 0.997 (0.995-0.999).

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 May 22;11(1):2583. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-16185-w.	Accurate and comprehensive measurements of economic well-being are fundamental inputs into both research and policy, but such measures are unavailable at a local level in many parts of the world. Here we train deep learning models to predict survey-based estimates of asset wealth across ~ 20,000 African villages from publicly-available multispectral satellite imagery. Models can explain 70% of the variation in ground-measured village wealth in countries where the model was not trained, outperforming previous benchmarks from high-resolution imagery, and comparison with independent wealth measurements from censuses suggests that errors in satellite estimates are comparable to errors in existing ground data. Satellite-based estimates can also explain up to 50% of the variation in district-aggregated changes in wealth over time, with daytime imagery particularly useful in this task. We demonstrate the utility of satellite-based estimates for research and policy, and demonstrate their scalability by creating a wealth map for Africa's most populous country.		20200522	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32444658

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 May 18;11(1):2473. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-16108-9.	In-memory computing using resistive memory devices is a promising non-von Neumann approach for making energy-efficient deep learning inference hardware. However, due to device variability and noise, the network needs to be trained in a specific way so that transferring the digitally trained weights to the analog resistive memory devices will not result in significant loss of accuracy. Here, we introduce a methodology to train ResNet-type convolutional neural networks that results in no appreciable accuracy loss when transferring weights to phase-change memory (PCM) devices. We also propose a compensation technique that exploits the batch normalization parameters to improve the accuracy retention over time. We achieve a classification accuracy of 93.7% on CIFAR-10 and a top-1 accuracy of 71.6% on ImageNet benchmarks after mapping the trained weights to PCM. Our hardware results on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-32 demonstrate an accuracy above 93.5% retained over a one-day period, where each of the 361,722 synaptic weights is programmed on just two PCM devices organized in a differential configuration.		20200518	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32424184

Through iterative self-learning, DESC gradually removes batch effects, as long as technical differences across batches are smaller than true biological variations. As a soft clustering algorithm, cluster assignment probabilities from DESC are biologically interpretable and can reveal both discrete and pseudotemporal structure of cells. Comprehensive evaluations show that DESC offers a proper balance of clustering accuracy and stability, has a small footprint on memory, does not explicitly require batch information for batch effect removal, and can utilize GPU when available. As the scale of single-cell studies continues to grow, we believe DESC will offer a valuable tool for biomedical researchers to disentangle complex cellular heterogeneity.		20200511	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32393754
Kim, Kyun Kyu; Ha, InHo; Kim, Min; Choi, Joonhwa; Won, Phillip; Jo, Sungho; Ko, Seung Hwan	A deep-learned skin sensor decoding the epicentral human motions.	Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 May 1;11(1):2149. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-16040-y.	State monitoring of the complex system needs a large number of sensors. Especially, studies in soft electronics aim to attain complete measurement of the body, mapping various stimulations like temperature, electrophysiological signals, and mechanical strains. However, conventional approach requires many sensor networks that cover the entire curvilinear surfaces of the target area. We introduce a new measuring system, a novel electronic skin integrated with a deep neural network that captures dynamic motions from a distance without creating a sensor network. The device detects minute deformations from the unique laser-induced crack structures. A single skin sensor decodes the complex motion of five finger motions in real-time, and the rapid situation learning (RSL) ensures stable operation regardless of its position on the wrist. The sensor is also capable of extracting gait motions from pelvis. This technology is expected to provide a turning point in health-monitoring, motion tracking, and soft robotics.		20200501	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32358525

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Apr 22;11(1):1934. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-15784-x.	Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) surpasses the optical diffraction limit and offers a two-fold enhancement in resolution over diffraction limited microscopy. However, it requires both intense illumination and multiple acquisitions to produce a single high-resolution image. Using deep learning to augment SIM, we obtain a five-fold reduction in the number of raw images required for super-resolution SIM, and generate images under extreme low light conditions (at least 100x fewer photons). We validate the performance of deep neural networks on different cellular structures and achieve multi-color, live-cell super-resolution imaging with greatly reduced photobleaching.		20200422	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32321916

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Apr 9;11(1):1760. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-15432-4.	The role of automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis in clinical practice is limited by the accuracy of existing models. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are models composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples. This technology has recently achieved striking success in a variety of task and there are great expectations on how it might improve clinical practice. Here we present a DNN model trained in a dataset with more than 2 million labeled exams analyzed by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais and collected under the scope of the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. The DNN outperform cardiology resident medical doctors in recognizing 6 types of abnormalities in 12-lead ECG recordings, with F1 scores above 80% and specificity over 99%. These results indicate ECG analysis based on DNNs, previously studied in a single-lead setup, generalizes well to 12-lead exams, taking the technology closer to the standard clinical practice.		20200409	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32273514

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Apr 9;11(1):1759. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-15456-w.	Genomics-based neoantigen discovery can be enhanced by proteomic evidence, but there remains a lack of consensus on the performance of different quality control methods for variant peptide identification in proteogenomics. We propose to use the difference between accurately predicted and observed retention times for each peptide as a metric to evaluate different quality control methods. To this end, we develop AutoRT, a deep learning algorithm with high accuracy in retention time prediction. Analysis of three cancer data sets with a total of 287 tumor samples using different quality control strategies results in substantially different numbers of identified variant peptides and putative neoantigens. Our systematic evaluation, using the proposed retention time metric, provides insights and practical guidance on the selection of quality control strategies. We implement the recommended strategy in a computational workflow named NeoFlow to support proteogenomics-based neoantigen prioritization, enabling more sensitive discovery of putative neoantigens.		20200409	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32273506

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Mar 25;11(1):1551. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-15086-2.	Recognizing human physical activities using wireless sensor networks has attracted significant research interest due to its broad range of applications, such as healthcare, rehabilitation, athletics, and senior monitoring. There are critical challenges inherent in designing a sensor-based activity recognition system operating in and around a lossy medium such as the human body to gain a trade-off among power consumption, cost, computational complexity, and accuracy. We introduce an innovative wireless system based on magnetic induction for human activity recognition to tackle these challenges and constraints. The magnetic induction system is integrated with machine learning techniques to detect a wide range of human motions. This approach is successfully evaluated using synthesized datasets, laboratory measurements, and deep recurrent neural networks.		20200325	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32214095

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Mar 6;11(1):1236. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-15027-z.	Accurate identification of axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement in patients with early-stage breast cancer is important for determining appropriate axillary treatment options and therefore avoiding unnecessary axillary surgery and complications. Here, we report deep learning radiomics (DLR) of conventional ultrasound and shear wave elastography of breast cancer for predicting ALN status preoperatively in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical parameter combined DLR yields the best diagnostic performance in predicting ALN status between disease-free axilla and any axillary metastasis with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.902 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.843, 0.961) in the test cohort. This clinical parameter combined DLR can also discriminate between low and heavy metastatic burden of axillary disease with AUC of 0.905 (95% CI: 0.814, 0.996) in the test cohort. Our study offers a noninvasive imaging biomarker to predict the metastatic extent of ALN for patients with early-stage breast cancer.		20200306	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32144248

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Mar 6;11(1):1162. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-14929-2.	By virtue of the combined merits of flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, imaging flow cytometry (IFC) has become an established tool for cell analysis in diverse biomedical fields such as cancer biology, microbiology, immunology, hematology, and stem cell biology. However, the performance and utility of IFC are severely limited by the fundamental trade-off between throughput, sensitivity, and spatial resolution. Here we present an optomechanical imaging method that overcomes the trade-off by virtually freezing the motion of flowing cells on the image sensor to effectively achieve 1000 times longer exposure time for microscopy-grade fluorescence image acquisition. Consequently, it enables high-throughput IFC of single cells at >10,000 cells s(-1) without sacrificing sensitivity and spatial resolution. The availability of numerous information-rich fluorescence cell images allows high-dimensional statistical analysis and accurate classification with deep learning, as evidenced by our demonstration of unique applications in hematology and microbiology.		20200306	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32139684

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Mar 3;11(1):1173. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-14974-x.	Chromatin interaction studies can reveal how the genome is organized into spatially confined sub-compartments in the nucleus. However, accurately identifying sub-compartments from chromatin interaction data remains a challenge in computational biology. Here, we present Sub-Compartment Identifier (SCI), an algorithm that uses graph embedding followed by unsupervised learning to predict sub-compartments using Hi-C chromatin interaction data. We find that the network topological centrality and clustering performance of SCI sub-compartment predictions are superior to those of hidden Markov model (HMM) sub-compartment predictions. Moreover, using orthogonal Chromatin Interaction Analysis by in-situ Paired-End Tag Sequencing (ChIA-PET) data, we confirmed that SCI sub-compartment prediction outperforms HMM. We show that SCI-predicted sub-compartments have distinct epigenetic marks, transcriptional activities, and transcription factor enrichment. Moreover, we present a deep neural network to predict sub-compartments using epigenome, replication timing, and sequence data. Our neural network predicts more accurate sub-compartment predictions when SCI-determined sub-compartments are used as labels for training.		20200303	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32127534

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Feb 10;11(1):808. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-14454-2.	Neural networks enjoy widespread success in both research and industry and, with the advent of quantum technology, it is a crucial challenge to design quantum neural networks for fully quantum learning tasks. Here we propose a truly quantum analogue of classical neurons, which form quantum feedforward neural networks capable of universal quantum computation. We describe the efficient training of these networks using the fidelity as a cost function, providing both classical and efficient quantum implementations. Our method allows for fast optimisation with reduced memory requirements: the number of qudits required scales with only the width, allowing deep-network optimisation. We benchmark our proposal for the quantum task of learning an unknown unitary and find remarkable generalisation behaviour and a striking robustness to noisy training data.		20200210	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32041956

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Feb 6;11(1):746. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-14578-5.	Stimuli are represented in the brain by the collective population responses of sensory neurons, and an object presented under varying conditions gives rise to a collection of neural population responses called an 'object manifold'. Changes in the object representation along a hierarchical sensory system are associated with changes in the geometry of those manifolds, and recent theoretical progress connects this geometry with 'classification capacity', a quantitative measure of the ability to support object classification. Deep neural networks trained on object classification tasks are a natural testbed for the applicability of this relation. We show how classification capacity improves along the hierarchies of deep neural networks with different architectures. We demonstrate that changes in the geometry of the associated object manifolds underlie this improved capacity, and shed light on the functional roles different levels in the hierarchy play to achieve it, through orchestrated reduction of manifolds' radius, dimensionality and inter-manifold correlations.		20200206	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32029727

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Feb 5;11(1):728. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-13825-8.	In cancer, the primary tumour's organ of origin and histopathology are the strongest determinants of its clinical behaviour, but in 3% of cases a patient presents with a metastatic tumour and no obvious primary. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, we train a deep learning classifier to predict cancer type based on patterns of somatic passenger mutations detected in whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 2606 tumours representing 24 common cancer types produced by the PCAWG Consortium. Our classifier achieves an accuracy of 91% on held-out tumor samples and 88% and 83% respectively on independent primary and metastatic samples, roughly double the accuracy of trained pathologists when presented with a metastatic tumour without knowledge of the primary. Surprisingly, adding information on driver mutations reduced accuracy. Our results have clinical applicability, underscore how patterns of somatic passenger mutations encode the state of the cell of origin, and can inform future strategies to detect the source of circulating tumour DNA.		20200205	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32024849

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Jan 10;11(1):183. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-13919-3.	The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) are cellularly and functionally diverse along their anterior-posterior and superficial-deep axes. Here, we find that anterior BLA (aBLA) and posterior BLA (pBLA) innervate deep-layer calbindin1-negative (Calb1-) and superficial-layer calbindin1-positive neurons (Calb1+) in vCA1, respectively. Photostimulation of pBLA-vCA1 inputs has an anxiolytic effect in mice, promoting approach behaviours during conflict exploratory tasks. By contrast, stimulating aBLA-vCA1 inputs induces anxiety-like behaviour resulting in fewer approaches. During conflict stages of the elevated plus maze task vCA1(Calb1+) neurons are preferentially activated at the open-to-closed arm transition, and photostimulation of vCA1(Calb1+) neurons at decision-making zones promotes approach with fewer retreats. In the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, which shows anxiety-like behaviour, photostimulating the pBLA-vCA1(Calb1+) circuit ameliorates the anxiety in a Calb1-dependent manner. These findings suggest the pBLA-vCA1(Calb1+) circuit from heterogeneous BLA-vCA1 connections drives approach behaviour to reduce anxiety-like behaviour.		20200110	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31924799

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Jan 9;11(1):146. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-13866-z.	Data-independent acquisition (DIA) is an emerging technology for quantitative proteomic analysis of large cohorts of samples. However, sample-specific spectral libraries built by data-dependent acquisition (DDA) experiments are required prior to DIA analysis, which is time-consuming and limits the identification/quantification by DIA to the peptides identified by DDA. Herein, we propose DeepDIA, a deep learning-based approach to generate in silico spectral libraries for DIA analysis. We demonstrate that the quality of in silico libraries predicted by instrument-specific models using DeepDIA is comparable to that of experimental libraries, and outperforms libraries generated by global models. With peptide detectability prediction, in silico libraries can be built directly from protein sequence databases. We further illustrate that DeepDIA can break through the limitation of DDA on peptide/protein detection, and enhance DIA analysis on human serum samples compared to the state-of-the-art protocol using a DDA library. We expect this work expanding the toolbox for DIA proteomics.		20200109	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31919359

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Jan 8;11(1):130. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-13922-8.	Center-involved diabetic macular edema (ci-DME) is a major cause of vision loss. Although the gold standard for diagnosis involves 3D imaging, 2D imaging by fundus photography is usually used in screening settings, resulting in high false-positive and false-negative calls. To address this, we train a deep learning model to predict ci-DME from fundus photographs, with an ROC-AUC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.87-0.91), corresponding to 85% sensitivity at 80% specificity. In comparison, retinal specialists have similar sensitivities (82-85%), but only half the specificity (45-50%, p < 0.001). Our model can also detect the presence of intraretinal fluid (AUC: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.81-0.86) and subretinal fluid (AUC 0.88; 95% CI: 0.85-0.91). Using deep learning to make predictions via simple 2D images without sophisticated 3D-imaging equipment and with better than specialist performance, has broad relevance to many other applications in medical imaging.		20200108	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31913272

Nat Commun	2020	Nat Commun. 2020 Jan 3;11(1):86. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-13749-3.	Here we report a facile, prompt protocol based on deep-learning techniques to sort out intricate phase identification and quantification problems in complex multiphase inorganic compounds. We simulate plausible powder X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns for 170 inorganic compounds in the Sr-Li-Al-O quaternary compositional pool, wherein promising LED phosphors have been recently discovered. Finally, 1,785,405 synthetic XRD patterns are prepared by combinatorically mixing the simulated powder XRD patterns of 170 inorganic compounds. Convolutional neural network (CNN) models are built and eventually trained using this large prepared dataset. The fully trained CNN model promptly and accurately identifies the constituent phases in complex multiphase inorganic compounds.

Machine learning has been extensively applied in small molecule analysis to predict a wide range of molecular properties and processes including mass spectrometry fragmentation or chromatographic retention time. However, current approaches for retention time prediction lack sufficient accuracy due to limited available experimental data. Here we introduce the METLIN small molecule retention time (SMRT) dataset, an experimentally acquired reverse-phase chromatography retention time dataset covering up to 80,038 small molecules. To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we deployed a deep learning model for retention time prediction applied to small molecule annotation. Results showed that in 70[Formula: see text] of the cases, the correct molecular identity was ranked among the top 3 candidates based on their predicted retention time. We anticipate that this dataset will enable the community to apply machine learning or first principles strategies to generate better models for retention time prediction.		20191220	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31862874

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Dec 18;10(1):5642. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-13647-8.	Deep learning algorithms have been successfully used in medical image classification. In the next stage, the technology of acquiring explainable knowledge from medical images is highly desired. Here we show that deep learning algorithm enables automated acquisition of explainable features from diagnostic annotation-free histopathology images. We compare the prediction accuracy of prostate cancer recurrence using our algorithm-generated features with that of diagnosis by expert pathologists using established criteria on 13,188 whole-mount pathology images consisting of over 86 billion image patches. Our method not only reveals findings established by humans but also features that have not been recognized, showing higher accuracy than human in prognostic prediction. Combining both our algorithm-generated features and human-established criteria predicts the recurrence more accurately than using either method alone. We confirm robustness of our method using external validation datasets including 2276 pathology images. This study opens up fields of machine learning analysis for discovering uncharted knowledge.		20191218	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31852890

Less discussed in neuroscience are parallel advances in "synthetic motor control". While motor neuroscience has recently focused on optimization of single, simple movements, AI has progressed to the generation of rich, diverse motor behaviors across multiple tasks, at humanoid scale. It is becoming clear that specific, well-motivated hierarchical design elements repeatedly arise when engineering these flexible control systems. We review these core principles of hierarchical control, relate them to hierarchy in the nervous system, and highlight research themes that we anticipate will be critical in solving challenges at this disciplinary intersection.		20191202	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31792198

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Nov 27;10(1):5407. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-13395-9.	The majority of our human genome transcribes into noncoding RNAs with unknown structures and functions. Obtaining functional clues for noncoding RNAs requires accurate base-pairing or secondary-structure prediction. However, the performance of such predictions by current folding-based algorithms has been stagnated for more than a decade. Here, we propose the use of deep contextual learning for base-pair prediction including those noncanonical and non-nested (pseudoknot) base pairs stabilized by tertiary interactions. Since only [Formula: see text]250 nonredundant, high-resolution RNA structures are available for model training, we utilize transfer learning from a model initially trained with a recent high-quality bpRNA dataset of [Formula: see text]10,000 nonredundant RNAs made available through comparative analysis. The resulting method achieves large, statistically significant improvement in predicting all base pairs, noncanonical and non-nested base pairs in particular. The proposed method (SPOT-RNA), with a freely available server and standalone software, should be useful for improving RNA structure modeling, sequence alignment, and functional annotations.		20191127	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31776342

However, eye-tracking technology is largely confined to laboratory-based settings, making it difficult to apply to large-scale studies. Here, we introduce a biologically-inspired solution that involves presenting, on a touch-sensitive interface, a Gaussian-blurred image that is locally unblurred by sliding a finger over the display. Thus, the user's finger movements provide a proxy for their eye movements and attention. We validated the method by showing strong correlations between attention maps obtained using finger-tracking vs. conventional optical eye-tracking. Using neural networks trained to predict empirically-derived attention maps, we established that identical high-level features hierarchically drive explorations with either method. Finally, the diagnostic value of digit-tracking was tested in autistic and brain-damaged patients. Rapid yet robust measures afforded by this method open the way to large scale applications in research and clinical settings.		20191126	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31772154

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Nov 22;10(1):5316. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-13297-w.	The current predictive modeling techniques applied to Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations have helped accelerate the process of materials discovery by providing significantly faster methods to scan materials candidates, thereby reducing the search space for future DFT computations and experiments. However, in addition to prediction error against DFT-computed properties, such predictive models also inherit the DFT-computation discrepancies against experimentally measured properties. To address this challenge, we demonstrate that using deep transfer learning, existing large DFT-computational data sets (such as the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD)) can be leveraged together with other smaller DFT-computed data sets as well as available experimental observations to build robust prediction models. We build a highly accurate model for predicting formation energy of materials from their compositions; using an experimental data set of [Formula: see text] observations, the proposed approach yields a mean absolute error (MAE) of [Formula: see text] eV/atom, which is significantly better than existing machine learning (ML) prediction modeling based on DFT computations and is comparable to the MAE of DFT-computation itself.		20191122	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31757948

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Nov 15;10(1):5024. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-12875-2.	Machine learning advances chemistry and materials science by enabling large-scale exploration of chemical space based on quantum chemical calculations. While these models supply fast and accurate predictions of atomistic chemical properties, they do not explicitly capture the electronic degrees of freedom of a molecule, which limits their applicability for reactive chemistry and chemical analysis. Here we present a deep learning framework for the prediction of the quantum mechanical wavefunction in a local basis of atomic orbitals from which all other ground-state properties can be derived. This approach retains full access to the electronic structure via the wavefunction at force-field-like efficiency and captures quantum mechanics in an analytically differentiable representation. On several examples, we demonstrate that this opens promising avenues to perform inverse design of molecular structures for targeting electronic property optimisation and a clear path towards increased synergy of machine learning and quantum chemistry.		20191115	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31729373

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Oct 30;10(1):4927. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-12898-9.	Raman optical spectroscopy promises label-free bacterial detection, identification, and antibiotic susceptibility testing in a single step. However, achieving clinically relevant speeds and accuracies remains challenging due to weak Raman signal from bacterial cells and numerous bacterial species and phenotypes. Here we generate an extensive dataset of bacterial Raman spectra and apply deep learning approaches to accurately identify 30 common bacterial pathogens. Even on low signal-to-noise spectra, we achieve average isolate-level accuracies exceeding 82% and antibiotic treatment identification accuracies of 97.0+/-0.3%. We also show that this approach distinguishes between methicillin-resistant and -susceptible isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and MSSA) with 89+/-0.1% accuracy. We validate our results on clinical isolates from 50 patients. Using just 10 bacterial spectra from each patient isolate, we achieve treatment identification accuracies of 99.7%. Our approach has potential for culture-free pathogen identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing, and could be readily extended for diagnostics on blood, urine, and sputum.		20191030	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31666527

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Oct 30;10(1):4941. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-12920-0.	Protein-RNA interaction plays important roles in post-transcriptional regulation. However, the task of predicting these interactions given a protein structure is difficult. Here we show that, by leveraging a deep learning model NucleicNet, attributes such as binding preference of RNA backbone constituents and different bases can be predicted from local physicochemical characteristics of protein structure surface. On a diverse set of challenging RNA-binding proteins, including Fem-3-binding-factor 2, Argonaute 2 and Ribonuclease III, NucleicNet can accurately recover interaction modes discovered by structural biology experiments. Furthermore, we show that, without seeing any in vitro or in vivo assay data, NucleicNet can still achieve consistency with experiments, including RNAcompete, Immunoprecipitation Assay, and siRNA Knockdown Benchmark. NucleicNet can thus serve to provide quantitative fitness of RNA sequences for given binding pockets or to predict potential binding pockets and binding RNAs for previously unknown RNA binding proteins.		20191030	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31666519

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Oct 22;10(1):4809. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-12750-0.	The ability to manipulate domains underpins function in applications of ferroelectrics. While there have been demonstrations of controlled nanoscale manipulation of domain structures to drive emergent properties, such approaches lack an internal feedback loop required for automatic manipulation. Here, using a deep sequence-to-sequence autoencoder we automate the extraction of latent features of nanoscale ferroelectric switching from piezoresponse force spectroscopy of tensile-strained PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 with a hierarchical domain structure. We identify characteristic behavior in the piezoresponse and cantilever resonance hysteresis loops, which allows for the classification and quantification of nanoscale-switching mechanisms. Specifically, we identify elastic hardening events which are associated with the nucleation and growth of charged domain walls. This work demonstrates the efficacy of unsupervised neural networks in learning features of a material's physical response from nanoscale multichannel hyperspectral imagery and provides new capabilities in leveraging in operando spectroscopies that could enable the automated manipulation of nanoscale structures in materials.		20191022	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31641122

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Oct 7;10(1):4551. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-12397-x.	Analysis of biomedical images requires computational expertize that are uncommon among biomedical scientists. Deep learning approaches for image analysis provide an opportunity to develop user-friendly tools for exploratory data analysis. Here, we use the visual programming toolbox Orange ( http://orange.biolab.si ) to simplify image analysis by integrating deep-learning embedding, machine learning procedures, and data visualization. Orange supports the construction of data analysis workflows by assembling components for data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling. We equipped Orange with components that use pre-trained deep convolutional networks to profile images with vectors of features. These vectors are used in image clustering and classification in a framework that enables mining of image sets for both novel and experienced users. We demonstrate the utility of the tool in image analysis of progenitor cells in mouse bone healing, identification of developmental competence in mouse oocytes, subcellular protein localization in yeast, and developmental morphology of social amoebae.		20191007	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31591416

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Oct 7;10(1):4554. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-12500-2.	Explaining colour variation among animals at broad geographic scales remains challenging. Here we demonstrate how deep learning-a form of artificial intelligence-can reveal subtle but robust patterns of colour feature variation along an ecological gradient, as well as help identify the underlying mechanisms generating this biogeographic pattern. Using over 20,000 images with precise GPS locality information belonging to nearly 2,000 moth species from Taiwan, our deep learning model generates a 2048-dimension feature vector that accurately predicts each species' mean elevation based on colour and shape features. Using this multidimensional feature vector, we find that within-assemblage image feature variation is smaller in high elevation assemblages. Structural equation modeling suggests that this reduced image feature diversity is likely the result of colder environments selecting for darker colouration, which limits the colour diversity of assemblages at high elevations. Ultimately, with the help of deep learning, we will be able to explore the endless forms of natural morphological variation at unpreceded depths.		20191007	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31591404

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Sep 19;10(1):4284. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-12281-8.	Highly specific Cas9 nucleases derived from SpCas9 are valuable tools for genome editing, but their wide applications are hampered by a lack of knowledge governing guide RNA (gRNA) activity. Here, we perform a genome-scale screen to measure gRNA activity for two highly specific SpCas9 variants (eSpCas9(1.1) and SpCas9-HF1) and wild-type SpCas9 (WT-SpCas9) in human cells, and obtain indel rates of over 50,000 gRNAs for each nuclease, covering ~20,000 genes. We evaluate the contribution of 1,031 features to gRNA activity and develope models for activity prediction. Our data reveals that a combination of RNN with important biological features outperforms other models for activity prediction. We further demonstrate that our model outperforms other popular gRNA design tools. Finally, we develop an online design tool DeepHF for the three Cas9 nucleases. The database, as well as the designer tool, is freely accessible via a web server, http://www.DeepHF.com/ .		20190919	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31537810

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Sep 4;10(1):3977. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-11994-0.	The inapplicability of amino acid covariation methods to small protein families has limited their use for structural annotation of whole genomes. Recently, deep learning has shown promise in allowing accurate residue-residue contact prediction even for shallow sequence alignments. Here we introduce DMPfold, which uses deep learning to predict inter-atomic distance bounds, the main chain hydrogen bond network, and torsion angles, which it uses to build models in an iterative fashion. DMPfold produces more accurate models than two popular methods for a test set of CASP12 domains, and works just as well for transmembrane proteins. Applied to all Pfam domains without known structures, confident models for 25% of these so-called dark families were produced in under a week on a small 200 core cluster. DMPfold provides models for 16% of human proteome UniProt entries without structures, generates accurate models with fewer than 100 sequences in some cases, and is freely available.		20190904	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31484923

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Aug 9;10(1):3591. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-11527-9.	Practice improves perception and enhances neural representations of trained visual stimuli, a phenomenon known as visual perceptual learning (VPL). While attention to task-relevant stimuli plays an important role in such learning, Pavlovian stimulus-reinforcer associations are sufficient to drive VPL, even subconsciously. It has been proposed that reinforcement facilitates perceptual learning through the activation of neuromodulatory centers, but this has not been directly confirmed in primates. Here, we paired task-irrelevant visual stimuli with microstimulation of a dopaminergic center, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), in macaques. Pairing VTA microstimulation with a task-irrelevant visual stimulus increased fMRI activity and improved classification of fMRI activity patterns selectively for the microstimulation-paired stimulus. Moreover, pairing VTA microstimulation with a task-irrelevant visual stimulus improved the subject's capacity to discriminate that stimulus. This is the first causal demonstration of the role of neuromodulatory centers in VPL in primates.		20190809	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31399570

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Aug 8;10(1):3573. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-11405-4.	The ability to rapidly learn from high-dimensional data to make reliable bets about the future is crucial in many contexts. This could be a fly avoiding predators, or the retina processing gigabytes of data to guide human actions. In this work we draw parallels between these and the efficient sampling of biomolecules with hundreds of thousands of atoms. For this we use the Predictive Information Bottleneck framework used for the first two problems, and re-formulate it for the sampling of biomolecules, especially when plagued with rare events. Our method uses a deep neural network to learn the minimally complex yet most predictive aspects of a given biomolecular trajectory. This information is used to perform iteratively biased simulations that enhance the sampling and directly obtain associated thermodynamic and kinetic information. We demonstrate the method on two test-pieces, studying processes slower than milliseconds, calculating free energies, kinetics and critical mutations.		20190808	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31395868

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Jul 15;10(1):3111. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-11012-3.	Biomedical repositories such as the UK Biobank provide increasing access to prospectively collected cardiac imaging, however these data are unlabeled, which creates barriers to their use in supervised machine learning. We develop a weakly supervised deep learning model for classification of aortic valve malformations using up to 4,000 unlabeled cardiac MRI sequences. Instead of requiring highly curated training data, weak supervision relies on noisy heuristics defined by domain experts to programmatically generate large-scale, imperfect training labels. For aortic valve classification, models trained with imperfect labels substantially outperform a supervised model trained on hand-labeled MRIs. In an orthogonal validation experiment using health outcomes data, our model identifies individuals with a 1.8-fold increase in risk of a major adverse cardiac event. This work formalizes a deep learning baseline for aortic valve classification and outlines a general strategy for using weak supervision to train machine learning models using unlabeled medical images at scale.		20190715	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31308376

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 May 15;10(1):2173. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-10212-1.	Neuropathologists assess vast brain areas to identify diverse and subtly-differentiated morphologies. Standard semi-quantitative scoring approaches, however, are coarse-grained and lack precise neuroanatomic localization. We report a proof-of-concept deep learning pipeline that identifies specific neuropathologies-amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy-in immunohistochemically-stained archival slides. Using automated segmentation of stained objects and a cloud-based interface, we annotate > 70,000 plaque candidates from 43 whole slide images (WSIs) to train and evaluate convolutional neural networks. Networks achieve strong plaque classification on a 10-WSI hold-out set (0.993 and 0.743 areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curve, respectively). Prediction confidence maps visualize morphology distributions at high resolution. Resulting network-derived amyloid beta (Abeta)-burden scores correlate well with established semi-quantitative scores on a 30-WSI blinded hold-out. Finally, saliency mapping demonstrates that networks learn patterns agreeing with accepted pathologic features. This scalable means to augment a neuropathologist's ability suggests a route to neuropathologic deep phenotyping.		20190515	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31092819

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Apr 4;10(1):1536. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-09557-4.	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a circuit-oriented treatment for mental disorders. Unfortunately, even well-conducted psychiatric DBS clinical trials have yielded inconsistent symptom relief, in part because DBS' mechanism(s) of action are unclear. One clue to those mechanisms may lie in the efficacy of ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum (VCVS) DBS in both major depression (MDD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). MDD and OCD both involve deficits in cognitive control. Cognitive control depends on prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions that project into the VCVS. Here, we show that VCVS DBS' effect is explained in part by enhancement of PFC-driven cognitive control. DBS improves human subjects' performance on a cognitive control task and increases theta (5-8Hz) oscillations in both medial and lateral PFC. The theta increase predicts subjects' clinical outcomes. Our results suggest a possible mechanistic approach to DBS therapy, based on tuning stimulation to optimize these neurophysiologic phenomena.		20190404	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30948727

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Jan 16;10(1):246. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-08089-7.	Since anatomically modern humans dispersed Out of Africa, the evolutionary history of Eurasian populations has been marked by introgressions from presently extinct hominins. Some of these introgressions have been identified using sequenced ancient genomes (Neanderthal and Denisova). Other introgressions have been proposed for still unidentified groups using the genetic diversity present in current human populations. We built a demographic model based on deep learning in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework to infer the evolutionary history of Eurasian populations including past introgression events in Out of Africa populations fitting the current genetic evidence. In addition to the reported Neanderthal and Denisovan introgressions, our results support a third introgression in all Asian and Oceanian populations from an archaic population. This population is either related to the Neanderthal-Denisova clade or diverged early from the Denisova lineage. We propose the use of deep learning methods for clarifying situations with high complexity in evolutionary genomics.		20190116	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30651539

Nat Commun	2019	Nat Commun. 2019 Jan 11;10(1):177. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-08179-6.	Two-photon microscopy is used to image neuronal activity, but has severe limitations for studying deeper cortical layers. Here, we developed a custom three-photon microscope optimized to image a vertical column of the cerebral cortex > 1 mm in depth in awake mice with low (<20 mW) average laser power. Our measurements of physiological responses and tissue-damage thresholds define pulse parameters and safety limits for damage-free three-photon imaging. We image functional visual responses of neurons expressing GCaMP6s across all layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) and in the subplate. These recordings reveal diverse visual selectivity in deep layers: layer 5 neurons are more broadly tuned to visual stimuli, whereas mean orientation selectivity of layer 6 neurons is slightly sharper, compared to neurons in other layers. Subplate neurons, located in the white matter below cortical layer 6 and characterized here for the first time, show low visual responsivity and broad orientation selectivity.		20190111	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30635577

Nat Commun	2018	Nat Commun. 2018 Nov 23;9(1):4950. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-07210-0.	Identifying coordinate transformations that make strongly nonlinear dynamics approximately linear has the potential to enable nonlinear prediction, estimation, and control using linear theory. The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding, and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings.		20181123	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30470743

Machine learning based on artificial neural networks has emerged as an efficient means to develop empirical models of complex systems. Cold atomic ensembles have become commonplace in laboratories around the world, however, many-body interactions give rise to complex dynamics that preclude precise analytic optimisation of the cooling and trapping process. Here, we implement a deep artificial neural network to optimise the magneto-optic cooling and trapping of neutral atomic ensembles. The solution identified by machine learning is radically different to the smoothly varying adiabatic solutions currently used. Despite this, the solutions outperform best known solutions producing higher optical densities.		20181019	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30341301

Nat Commun	2018	Nat Commun. 2018 Sep 18;9(1):3800. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-06322-x.	Predicting the stability of crystals is one of the central problems in materials science. Today, density functional theory (DFT) calculations remain comparatively expensive and scale poorly with system size. Here we show that deep neural networks utilizing just two descriptors-the Pauling electronegativity and ionic radii-can predict the DFT formation energies of C3A2D3O12 garnets and ABO3 perovskites with low mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 7-10 meV atom(-1) and 20-34 meV atom(-1), respectively, well within the limits of DFT accuracy. Further extension to mixed garnets and perovskites with little loss in accuracy can be achieved using a binary encoding scheme, addressing a critical gap in the extension of machine-learning models from fixed stoichiometry crystals to infinite universe of mixed-species crystals. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of these models to rapidly transverse vast chemical spaces to accurately identify stable compositions, accelerating the discovery of novel materials with potentially superior properties.		20180918	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30228262

Nat Commun	2018	Nat Commun. 2018 Sep 6;9(1):3601. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-06046-y.	Argonaute crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) experiments are the most widely used high-throughput methodologies for miRNA targetome characterization. The analysis of Photoactivatable Ribonucleoside-Enhanced (PAR) CLIP methodology focuses on sequence clusters containing T-to-C conversions. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the non-T-to-C clusters, frequently observed in PAR-CLIP experiments, exhibit functional miRNA-binding events and strong RNA accessibility. This discovery is based on the analysis of an extensive compendium of bona fide miRNA-binding events, and is further supported by numerous miRNA perturbation experiments and structural sequencing data. The incorporation of these previously neglected clusters yields an average of 14% increase in miRNA-target interactions per PAR-CLIP library. Our findings are integrated in microCLIP ( www.microrna.gr/microCLIP ), a cutting-edge framework that combines deep learning classifiers under a super learning scheme. The increased performance of microCLIP in CLIP-Seq-guided detection of miRNA interactions, uncovers previously elusive regulatory events and miRNA-controlled pathways.		20180906	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30190538
Xiao, Le; Bornmann, Caroline; Hatstatt-Burkle, Laetitia; Scheiffele, Peter	Regulation of striatal cells and goal-directed behavior by cerebellar outputs.	Nat Commun	2018	Nat Commun. 2018 Aug 7;9(1):3133. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-05565-y.	The cerebellum integrates descending motor commands and sensory information to generate predictions and detect errors during ongoing behaviors. Cerebellar computation has been proposed to control motor but also non-motor behaviors, including reward expectation and cognitive flexibility. However, the organization and functional contribution of cerebellar output channels are incompletely understood. Here, we elaborate the cell-type specificity of a broad connectivity matrix from the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) to the dorsal striatum in mice. Cerebello-striatal connections arise from all deep cerebellar subnuclei and are relayed through intralaminar thalamic nuclei (ILN). In the dorsal striatum, these connections target medium spiny neurons, but also ChAT-positive interneurons, a class of tonically active interneurons implicated in shifting and updating behavioral strategies. Chemogenetic silencing of cerebello-striatal connectivity modifies function of striatal ChAT-positive interneurons. We propose that cerebello-striatal connections relay cerebellar computation to striatal circuits for goal-directed behaviors.		20180807	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30087345

Genetic engineering projects are rapidly growing in scale and complexity, driven by new tools to design and construct DNA. There is increasing concern that widened access to these technologies could lead to attempts to construct cells for malicious intent, illegal drug production, or to steal intellectual property. Determining the origin of a DNA sequence is difficult and time-consuming. Here deep learning is applied to predict the lab-of-origin of a DNA sequence. A convolutional neural network was trained on the Addgene plasmid dataset that contained 42,364 engineered DNA sequences from 2230 labs as of February 2016. The network correctly identifies the source lab 48% of the time and 70% it appears in the top 10 predicted labs. Often, there is not a single "smoking gun" that affiliates a DNA sequence with a lab. Rather, it is a combination of design choices that are individually common but collectively reveal the designer.		20180807	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30087331
Yoon, Leehyun; Somerville, Leah H; Kim, Hackjin	Development of MPFC function mediates shifts in self-protective behavior provoked by social feedback.	Nat Commun	2018	Nat Commun. 2018 Aug 6;9(1):3086. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-05553-2.	How do people protect themselves in response to negative social feedback from others? How does such a self-protective system develop and affect social decisions? Here, using a novel reciprocal artwork evaluation task, we demonstrate that youths show self-protective bias based on current negative social evaluation, whereas into early adulthood, individuals show self-protective bias based on accumulated evidence of negative social evaluation. While the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) mediates self-defensive behavior based on both current and accumulated feedback, the rostromedial prefrontal cortex (RMPFC) exclusively mediates self-defensive behavior based on longer feedback history. Further analysis using a reinforcement learning model suggests that RMPFC extending into VMPFC, together with posterior parietal cortex (PPC), contribute to age-related increases in self-protection bias with deep feedback integration by computing the discrepancy between current feedback and previously estimated value of self-protection. These findings indicate that the development of RMPFC function is critical for sophisticated self-protective decisions.		20180806	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30082718

Nat Commun	2018	Nat Commun. 2018 Jul 17;9(1):2775. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-05169-6.	Computational methods that automatically extract knowledge from data are critical for enabling data-driven materials science. A reliable identification of lattice symmetry is a crucial first step for materials characterization and analytics. Current methods require a user-specified threshold, and are unable to detect average symmetries for defective structures. Here, we propose a machine learning-based approach to automatically classify structures by crystal symmetry. First, we represent crystals by calculating a diffraction image, then construct a deep learning neural network model for classification. Our approach is able to correctly classify a dataset comprising more than 100,000 simulated crystal structures, including heavily defective ones. The internal operations of the neural network are unraveled through attentive response maps, demonstrating that it uses the same landmarks a materials scientist would use, although never explicitly instructed to do so. Our study paves the way for crystal structure recognition of-possibly noisy and incomplete-three-dimensional structural data in big-data materials science.		20180717	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30018362

Nat Commun	2018	Nat Commun. 2018 Jun 19;9(1):2383. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-04316-3.	Through the success of deep learning in various domains, artificial neural networks are currently among the most used artificial intelligence methods. Taking inspiration from the network properties of biological neural networks (e.g. sparsity, scale-freeness), we argue that (contrary to general practice) artificial neural networks, too, should not have fully-connected layers. Here we propose sparse evolutionary training of artificial neural networks, an algorithm which evolves an initial sparse topology (Erdos-Renyi random graph) of two consecutive layers of neurons into a scale-free topology, during learning. Our method replaces artificial neural networks fully-connected layers with sparse ones before training, reducing quadratically the number of parameters, with no decrease in accuracy. We demonstrate our claims on restricted Boltzmann machines, multi-layer perceptrons, and convolutional neural networks for unsupervised and supervised learning on 15 datasets. Our approach has the potential to enable artificial neural networks to scale up beyond what is currently possible.		20180619	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29921910

Nat Commun	2018	Nat Commun. 2018 Feb 21;9(1):750. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-03113-2.	Although Hi-C technology is one of the most popular tools for studying 3D genome organization, due to sequencing cost, the resolution of most Hi-C datasets are coarse and cannot be used to link distal regulatory elements to their target genes. Here we develop HiCPlus, a computational approach based on deep convolutional neural network, to infer high-resolution Hi-C interaction matrices from low-resolution Hi-C data. We demonstrate that HiCPlus can impute interaction matrices highly similar to the original ones, while only using 1/16 of the original sequencing reads. We show that the models learned from one cell type can be applied to make predictions in other cell or tissue types. Our work not only provides a computational framework to enhance Hi-C data resolution but also reveals features underlying the formation of 3D chromatin interactions.		20180221	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29467363

Nat Commun	2018	Nat Commun. 2018 Feb 1;9(1):469. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-02516-x.	Knowledge about the statistical regularities of the world is essential for cognitive and sensorimotor function. In the domain of timing, prior statistics are crucial for optimal prediction, adaptation and planning. Where and how the nervous system encodes temporal statistics is, however, not known. Based on physiological and anatomical evidence for cerebellar learning, we develop a computational model that demonstrates how the cerebellum could learn prior distributions of time intervals and support Bayesian temporal estimation. The model shows that salient features observed in human Bayesian time interval estimates can be readily captured by learning in the cerebellar cortex and circuit level computations in the cerebellar deep nuclei. We test human behavior in two cerebellar timing tasks and find prior-dependent biases in timing that are consistent with the predictions of the cerebellar model.		20180201	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29391392
Pang, Long-Gang; Zhou, Kai; Su, Nan; Petersen, Hannah; Stocker, Horst; Wang, Xin-Nian	An equation-of-state-meter of quantum chromodynamics transition from deep learning.	Nat Commun	2018	Nat Commun. 2018 Jan 15;9(1):210. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-02726-3.	A primordial state of matter consisting of free quarks and gluons that existed in the early universe a few microseconds after the Big Bang is also expected to form in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Determining the equation of state (EoS) of such a primordial matter is the ultimate goal of high-energy heavy-ion experiments. Here we use supervised learning with a deep convolutional neural network to identify the EoS employed in the relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of heavy ion collisions. High-level correlations of particle spectra in transverse momentum and azimuthal angle learned by the network act as an effective EoS-meter in deciphering the nature of the phase transition in quantum chromodynamics. Such EoS-meter is model-independent and insensitive to other simulation inputs including the initial conditions for hydrodynamic simulations.		20180115	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29335457

There is an increasing demand for computing the relevant structures, equilibria, and long-timescale kinetics of biomolecular processes, such as protein-drug binding, from high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations. Current methods employ transformation of simulated coordinates into structural features, dimension reduction, clustering the dimension-reduced data, and estimation of a Markov state model or related model of the interconversion rates between molecular structures. This handcrafted approach demands a substantial amount of modeling expertise, as poor decisions at any step will lead to large modeling errors. Here we employ the variational approach for Markov processes (VAMP) to develop a deep learning framework for molecular kinetics using neural networks, dubbed VAMPnets. A VAMPnet encodes the entire mapping from molecular coordinates to Markov states, thus combining the whole data processing pipeline in a single end-to-end framework. Our method performs equally or better than state-of-the-art Markov modeling methods and provides easily interpretable few-state kinetic models.		20180102	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29295994
Choe, Il-Hwan; Byun, Junweon; Kim, Ko Keun; Park, Sol; Kim, Isaac; Jeong, Jaeseung; Shin, Hee-Sup	Mice in social conflict show rule-observance behavior enhancing long-term benefit.	Nat Commun	2017	Nat Commun. 2017 Nov 7;8(1):1176. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-01091-5.	Disorderly resolution of conflict is costly, whereas orderly resolution by consent rules enables quick settlement. However, it is unclear whether non-human animals can make and observe rules to resolve conflict without aggression. Here we report a new behavioral paradigm for mice: a modified two-armed maze that uses wireless electrical brain stimulation as reward. First, the mice were individually operant-trained to initiate and then receive the reward at the signaled arm. Next, two mice were coupled and had to cooperate to initiate reward but then to compete over reward allocation. Mice develop and observe a rule of reward zone allocation that increases the total amount of reward and reward equity between the pair. In the mutual rule-observance behavior, positive reciprocity and tolerance to the other's violation are also observed. These findings suggest that rodents can learn to make and observe rules to resolve conflict, enhancing long-term benefit and payoff equity.		20171107	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29109508

Part of the challenge for quantum many-body problems comes from the difficulty of representing large-scale quantum states, which in general requires an exponentially large number of parameters. Neural networks provide a powerful tool to represent quantum many-body states. An important open question is what characterizes the representational power of deep and shallow neural networks, which is of fundamental interest due to the popularity of deep learning methods. Here, we give a proof that, assuming a widely believed computational complexity conjecture, a deep neural network can efficiently represent most physical states, including the ground states of many-body Hamiltonians and states generated by quantum dynamics, while a shallow network representation with a restricted Boltzmann machine cannot efficiently represent some of those states.One of the challenges in studies of quantum many-body physics is finding an efficient way to record the large system wavefunctions. Here the authors present an analysis of the capabilities of recently-proposed neural network representations for storing physically accessible quantum states.		20170922	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28939812
Case, Daniel T; Burton, Shawn D; Gedeon, Jeremy Y; Williams, Sean-Paul G; Urban, Nathaniel N; Seal, Rebecca P	Layer- and cell type-selective co-transmission by a basal forebrain cholinergic projection to the olfactory bulb.	Nat Commun	2017	Nat Commun. 2017 Sep 21;8(1):652. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00765-4.	Cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain project heavily to the main olfactory bulb, the first processing station in the olfactory pathway. The projections innervate multiple layers of the main olfactory bulb and strongly influence odor discrimination, detection, and learning. The precise underlying circuitry of this cholinergic input to the main olfactory bulb remains unclear, however. Here, we identify a specific basal forebrain cholinergic projection that innervates select neurons concentrated in the internal plexiform layer of the main olfactory bulb. Optogenetic activation of this projection elicits monosynaptic nicotinic and GABAergic currents in glomerular layer-projecting interneurons. Additionally, we show that the projection co-expresses markers for GABAergic neurotransmission. The data thus implicate neurotransmitter co-transmission in the basal forebrain regulation of this inhibitory olfactory microcircuit.Cholinergic neurons innervate multiple layers in the main olfactory bulb but the precise circuitry of this input is not known. Here the authors show that VGLUT3(+) cholinergic neurons selectively innervate deep short axon cells in specific layers and elicit robust monosynaptic GABAergic and nicotinic postsynaptic currents.		20170921	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28935940

Nat Commun	2017	Nat Commun. 2017 Sep 6;8(1):463. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00623-3.	We show that deep convolutional neural networks combined with nonlinear dimension reduction enable reconstructing biological processes based on raw image data. We demonstrate this by reconstructing the cell cycle of Jurkat cells and disease progression in diabetic retinopathy. In further analysis of Jurkat cells, we detect and separate a subpopulation of dead cells in an unsupervised manner and, in classifying discrete cell cycle stages, we reach a sixfold reduction in error rate compared to a recent approach based on boosting on image features. In contrast to previous methods, deep learning based predictions are fast enough for on-the-fly analysis in an imaging flow cytometer.The interpretation of information-rich, high-throughput single-cell data is a challenge requiring sophisticated computational tools. Here the authors demonstrate a deep convolutional neural network that can classify cell cycle status on-the-fly.		20170906	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28878212

Nat Commun	2017	Nat Commun. 2017 Aug 8;8(1):179. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00071-z.	Sleep and memory are deeply related, but the nature of the neuroplastic processes induced by sleep remains unclear. Here, we report that memory traces can be both formed or suppressed during sleep, depending on sleep phase. We played samples of acoustic noise to sleeping human listeners. Repeated exposure to a novel noise during Rapid Eye Movements (REM) or light non-REM (NREM) sleep leads to improvements in behavioral performance upon awakening. Strikingly, the same exposure during deep NREM sleep leads to impaired performance upon awakening. Electroencephalographic markers of learning extracted during sleep confirm a dissociation between sleep facilitating memory formation (light NREM and REM sleep) and sleep suppressing learning (deep NREM sleep). We can trace these neural changes back to transient sleep events, such as spindles for memory facilitation and slow waves for suppression. Thus, highly selective memory processes are active during human sleep, with intertwined episodes of facilitative and suppressive plasticity.Though memory and sleep are related, it is still unclear whether new memories can be formed during sleep. Here, authors show that people could learn new sounds during REM or light non-REM sleep, but that learning was suppressed when sounds were played during deep NREM sleep.		20170808	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28790302

Nat Commun	2017	Nat Commun. 2017 Jun 9;8:15834. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15834.	The mechanisms underlying the emergence of learned motor skill representation in primary motor cortex (M1) are not well understood. Specifically, how motor representation in the deep output layer 5b (L5b) is shaped by motor learning remains virtually unknown. In rats undergoing motor skill training, we detect a subpopulation of task-recruited L5b neurons that not only become more movement-encoding, but their activities are also more structured and temporally aligned to motor execution with a timescale of refinement in tens-of-milliseconds. Field potentials evoked at L5b in vivo exhibit persistent long-term potentiation (LTP) that parallels motor performance. Intracortical dopamine denervation impairs motor learning, and disrupts the LTP profile as well as the emergent neurodynamical properties of task-recruited L5b neurons. Thus, dopamine-dependent recruitment of L5b neuronal ensembles via synaptic reorganization may allow the motor cortex to generate more temporally structured, movement-encoding output signal from M1 to downstream circuitry that drives increased uniformity and precision of movement during motor learning.		20170609	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28598433

Nat Commun	2017	Nat Commun. 2017 May 22;8:15405. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15405.	It is hypothesized that deep sleep is essential for restoring the brain's capacity to learn efficiently, especially in regions heavily activated during the day. However, causal evidence in humans has been lacking due to the inability to sleep deprive one target area while keeping the natural sleep pattern intact. Here we introduce a novel approach to focally perturb deep sleep in motor cortex, and investigate the consequences on behavioural and neurophysiological markers of neuroplasticity arising from dedicated motor practice. We show that the capacity to undergo neuroplastic changes is reduced by wakefulness but restored during unperturbed sleep. This restorative process is markedly attenuated when slow waves are selectively perturbed in motor cortex, demonstrating that deep sleep is a requirement for maintaining sustainable learning efficiency.		20170522	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28530229

Nat Commun	2017	Nat Commun. 2017 Jan 9;8:13890. doi: 10.1038/ncomms13890.	Learning from data has led to paradigm shifts in a multitude of disciplines, including web, text and image search, speech recognition, as well as bioinformatics. Can machine learning enable similar breakthroughs in understanding quantum many-body systems? Here we develop an efficient deep learning approach that enables spatially and chemically resolved insights into quantum-mechanical observables of molecular systems. We unify concepts from many-body Hamiltonians with purpose-designed deep tensor neural networks, which leads to size-extensive and uniformly accurate (1 kcal mol(-1)) predictions in compositional and configurational chemical space for molecules of intermediate size. As an example of chemical relevance, the model reveals a classification of aromatic rings with respect to their stability. Further applications of our model for predicting atomic energies and local chemical potentials in molecules, reliable isomer energies, and molecules with peculiar electronic structure demonstrate the potential of machine learning for revealing insights into complex quantum-chemical systems.		20170109	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28067221

Nat Commun	2016	Nat Commun. 2016 Nov 8;7:13276. doi: 10.1038/ncomms13276.	The brain processes information through multiple layers of neurons. This deep architecture is representationally powerful, but complicates learning because it is difficult to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In machine learning, the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame by multiplying error signals with all the synaptic weights on each neuron's axon and further downstream. However, this involves a precise, symmetric backward connectivity pattern, which is thought to be impossible in the brain. Here we demonstrate that this strong architectural constraint is not required for effective error propagation. We present a surprisingly simple mechanism that assigns blame by multiplying errors by even random synaptic weights. This mechanism can transmit teaching signals across multiple layers of neurons and performs as effectively as backpropagation on a variety of tasks. Our results help reopen questions about how the brain could use error signals and dispel long-held assumptions about algorithmic constraints on learning.		20161108	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27824044

Collisions at high-energy particle colliders are a traditionally fruitful source of exotic particle discoveries. Finding these rare particles requires solving difficult signal-versus-background classification problems, hence machine-learning approaches are often used. Standard approaches have relied on 'shallow' machine-learning models that have a limited capacity to learn complex nonlinear functions of the inputs, and rely on a painstaking search through manually constructed nonlinear features. Progress on this problem has slowed, as a variety of techniques have shown equivalent performance. Recent advances in the field of deep learning make it possible to learn more complex functions and better discriminate between signal and background classes. Here, using benchmark data sets, we show that deep-learning methods need no manually constructed inputs and yet improve the classification metric by as much as 8% over the best current approaches. This demonstrates that deep-learning approaches can improve the power of collider searches for exotic particles.		20140702	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24986233
