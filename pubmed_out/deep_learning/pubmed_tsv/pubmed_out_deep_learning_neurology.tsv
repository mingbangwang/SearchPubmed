Neurology	2021	Neurology. 2021 Feb 10. pii: WNL.0000000000011654. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000011654.	OBJECTIVE: We developed and investigated the feasibility of a machine learning-based automated rating for the two cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD); resting tremor and bradykinesia. METHODS: Using Openpose, a deep-learning-based human pose estimation program, we analyzed video-clips for resting tremor and finger tapping of the bilateral upper limbs of 55 patients with PD (110 arms). Key motion parameters, including resting tremor amplitude and finger tapping speed, amplitude, and fatigue, were extracted to develop a machine learning-based automatic Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) rating using support vector machine (SVM) method. To evaluate the performance of this model, we calculated weighted kappa and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) between the model and the gold standard rating by a movement disorder specialist who is trained and certified by the movement disorder society (MDS) for UPDRS rating. These values were compared to weighted kappa and ICC between a non-trained human rater and the gold standard rating. RESULTS: For resting tremors, the SVM model showed a very good to excellent reliability range with the gold standard rating (kappa 0.791; ICC 0.927), with both values higher than that of non-trained human rater (kappa 0.662; ICC 0.861). For finger tapping, the SVM model showed a very good reliability range with the gold standard rating (kappa 0.700 and ICC 0.793), which was comparable to non-trained human raters (kappa 0.627; ICC 0.797). CONCLUSION: Machine learning-based algorithms that automatically rate PD cardinal symptoms are feasible, with more accurate results than non-trained human rating results. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that machine learning-based automated rating of resting tremor and bradykinesia in people with PD has very good reliability compared to a rating by a movement disorder specialist.		20210210	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33568548

Neurology	2020	Neurology. 2020 Jul 7;95(1):e79-e88. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000009728. Epub 2020 Jun 3.	OBJECTIVE: To examine etiologic stroke subtypes and vascular risk factor profiles and their association with white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden in patients hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). METHODS: For the MRI Genetics Interface Exploration (MRI-GENIE) study, we systematically assembled brain imaging and phenotypic data for 3,301 patients with AIS. All cases underwent standardized web tool-based stroke subtyping with the Causative Classification of Ischemic Stroke (CCS). WMH volume (WMHv) was measured on T2 brain MRI scans of 2,529 patients with a fully automated deep-learning trained algorithm. Univariable and multivariable linear mixed-effects modeling was carried out to investigate the relationship of vascular risk factors with WMHv and CCS subtypes. RESULTS: Patients with AIS with large artery atherosclerosis, major cardioembolic stroke, small artery occlusion (SAO), other, and undetermined causes of AIS differed significantly in their vascular risk factor profile (all p < 0.001). Median WMHv in all patients with AIS was 5.86 cm(3) (interquartile range 2.18-14.61 cm(3)) and differed significantly across CCS subtypes (p < 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, age, hypertension, prior stroke, smoking (all p < 0.001), and diabetes mellitus (p = 0.041) were independent predictors of WMHv. When adjusted for confounders, patients with SAO had significantly higher WMHv compared to those with all other stroke subtypes (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this international multicenter, hospital-based cohort of patients with AIS, we demonstrate that vascular risk factor profiles and extent of WMH burden differ by CCS subtype, with the highest lesion burden detected in patients with SAO. These findings further support the small vessel hypothesis of WMH lesions detected on brain MRI of patients with ischemic stroke.		20200603	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32493718

Neurology	2014	Neurology. 2014 Oct 28;83(18):1627-33. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000943. Epub 2014 Oct 1.	OBJECTIVES: To examine disease, treatment, cognitive, and psychological factors associated with quality of life (QoL) before and after surgery and assess the ability to predict QoL outcomes. METHODS: We identified a retrospective, cross-sectional sample of 85 patients with Parkinson disease who underwent subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS). Patients' QoL was categorized as "improved" and "stable/worsened" using reliable change indices. Univariate correlational analyses identified relationships between Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 ratings and disease (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III [UPDRS-III] motor scores on and off medications, disease duration), treatment (medication burden, unilateral vs bilateral DBS), cognitive (neuropsychological battery), and psychological (depression) variables. Step-wise multiple linear regression and logistic regression models included selected preoperative variables to predict change in QoL ratings and QoL outcome after surgery. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of patients reported clinically significant improvements in QoL while 47% reported stable QoL and 2% worsened. Motor scores (UPDRS-III) were not relevant to QoL changes, potentially because of the rarity of poor motor outcomes, while single-trial learning and depression scores were the most important variables in predicting QoL changes. There was a subtle additional benefit to undergoing bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide greater insight into the nonmotor features that contribute to the success of subthalamic nucleus DBS procedures from the patient's perspective and raise questions about the treatment focus and emphasis on symptom profiles in DBS candidacy evaluations.		20141001	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25274851

Neurology	2011	Neurology. 2011 Oct 11;77(15):1446-52. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318232ab1d. Epub 2011 Sep 28.	OBJECTIVES: Cerebral microbleeds (MBs) are an important indicator of cerebral small-vessel disease, and their prevalence increases with increasing age. Little is known about the functional consequences of MBs in the aging population. In this study we investigated whether the presence and location of MBs are associated with cognition in the PROSPER study. METHODS: For 439 subjects the number and location (cortico-subcortical, deep white matter, basal ganglia, and infratentorial) of the MBs was recorded. Difference in cognitive performance between subjects with and without MBs was calculated by entering the variables sex, age, white matter hyperintensity volume, infarction, and MBs in a linear mixed model. Differences in cognition between subjects with and without one or more MBs at different anatomic locations were assessed using the same model. RESULTS: We found that after correction for sex, age, white matter hyperintensity volume, and infarction, subjects with infratentorial MBs had a significantly lower score on the Immediate Picture-Word Learning test, Delayed Picture-Word Learning, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that in elderly individuals at increased vascular risk, infratentorial MBs are associated with loss in cognitive functioning.		20110928	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21956727
Kalbe, E; Voges, J; Weber, T; Haarer, M; Baudrexel, S; Klein, J C; Kessler, J; Sturm, V; Heiss, W D; Hilker, R	Frontal FDG-PET activity correlates with cognitive outcome after STN-DBS in Parkinson disease.	Neurology	2009	Neurology. 2009 Jan 6;72(1):42-9. doi: 10.1212/01.wnl.0000338536.31388.f0.	BACKGROUND: Inconsistent changes of cognitive functioning have been reported in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). To investigate the underlying pathomechanisms, we correlated alterations of cognitive test performance and changes of neuronal energy metabolism in frontal basal ganglia projection areas under bilateral STN stimulation. METHODS: We conducted verbal fluency, learning, and memory tests and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET in nine patients with PD with STN-DBS before and 6 months after surgery. Using coregistered MRI, postoperative changes of the normalized cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (nCMRGlc) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), lateral orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC), ventral and dorsal cingulum (v/dACC), and in Broca area were determined and correlated with alterations of neuropsychological test results. RESULTS: After surgery, highly variable changes of both cognitive test performance and frontal nCMRGlc values were found with significant correlations between verbal fluency and FDG uptake in the left DLPFC (Brodmann area [BA] 9, 46), left Broca area (BA 44/45), and the right dACC (BA 32). A decrease of nCMRGlc in the left OFC (BA 11/47) and dACC (BA 32) correlated with a decline of verbal learning. All patients showed reduced metabolic activity in the right anterior cingulate cortex after DBS. Baseline cognitive abilities did not predict verbal learning or fluency changes after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: These data show a significant linear relationship between changes in frontal 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET activity and changes in cognitive outcome after deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in advanced Parkinson disease. The best correlations were found in the left frontal lobe (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and Broca area). Baseline performance on cognitive tests did not predict cognitive or metabolic changes after STN electrode implantation.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19122029
Rodriguez-Oroz, M C; Gorospe, A; Guridi, J; Ramos, E; Linazasoro, G; Rodriguez-Palmero, M; Obeso, J A	Bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease.	Neurology	2000	Neurology. 2000;55(12 Suppl 6):S45-51.	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is rapidly becoming the preferred surgical choice for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). We report initial results in 15 patients after 12 months and in nine patients evaluated between 30 and 36 months postoperatively. Our experience confirms the robust antiparkinsonian effect of DBS of the STN in advanced PD. The severity of "off" episodes, as assessed by the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), was drastically reduced by 74% at 12 months, and dyskinesia scores (Dyskinesia Rating Scale) decreased. The levodopa daily dose was reduced by 55% at 12 months. A double-blind assessment to determine the effect of stimulation performed in nine patients at 3 months in the "off" medication condition was very significant (p<0.05). Nine patients have been followed for 3 years with maintained efficacy in the UPDRS "off" score and the dyskinesia score. The experience of other groups using a similar technique is reviewed. The overall assessment indicates a high antiparkinsonian effect of DBS of the STN even in advanced patients. The existence of a learning curve for this procedure should be taken into account when initial results are evaluated.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11188975
Pillon, B; Ardouin, C; Damier, P; Krack, P; Houeto, J L; Klinger, H; Bonnet, A M; Pollak, P; Benabid, A L; Agid, Y	Neuropsychological changes between "off" and "on" STN or GPi stimulation in Parkinson's disease.	Neurology	2000	Neurology. 2000 Aug 8;55(3):411-8. doi: 10.1212/wnl.55.3.411.	BACKGROUND: In a previous study on a consecutive series of 62 patients with PD, the authors showed that bilateral subthalamic or pallidal continuous high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) affects neither memory nor executive functions 3 to 6 months after surgery. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the specific effects of DBS by comparing the performance of patients with the stimulator turned "on" and "off." METHODS: The performance of 56 patients on clinical tests of executive function was compared after 3 and 12 months of DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN; n = 48) or the internal globus pallidus (GPi; n = 8) with the stimulator "on" or "off." Global intellectual efficiency, verbal learning, and mood were also evaluated with the stimulator "on." The performance of another group of 20 patients was compared after 6 months of DBS of the STN (n = 15) or the GPi (n = 5) with the stimulator "on" or "off" on more experimental tests recently shown to be more sensitive to l-dopa therapy. RESULTS: When the stimulator was "on," STN patients showed a mild but significant improvement in psychomotor speed and working memory. In comparison with the presurgical state, STN patients had no cognitive deficit at 12 months, except for lexical fluency. There was no differential effect of STN or GPi stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: 1) The specific effect of DBS seems to mimic the action of l-dopa treatment in the cognitive as in the motor domain; 2) the surgery associated with DBS does not appear to affect the cognitive performance of patients with PD 12 months later, except for a mild deficit in lexical fluency.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10932277
