Pediatrics	2021	Pediatrics. 2021 Mar;147(3). pii: peds.2020-016618. doi: 10.1542/peds.2020-016618.	OBJECTIVES: Childhood blindness from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is increasing as a result of improvements in neonatal care worldwide. We evaluate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening in an Indian ROP telemedicine program and whether differences in ROP severity between neonatal care units (NCUs) identified by using AI are related to differences in oxygen-titrating capability. METHODS: External validation study of an existing AI-based quantitative severity scale for ROP on a data set of images from the Retinopathy of Prematurity Eradication Save Our Sight ROP telemedicine program in India. All images were assigned an ROP severity score (1-9) by using the Imaging and Informatics in Retinopathy of Prematurity Deep Learning system. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and sensitivity and specificity for treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity. Using multivariable linear regression, we evaluated the mean and median ROP severity in each NCU as a function of mean birth weight, gestational age, and the presence of oxygen blenders and pulse oxygenation monitors. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detection of treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity was 0.98, with 100% sensitivity and 78% specificity. We found higher median (interquartile range) ROP severity in NCUs without oxygen blenders and pulse oxygenation monitors, most apparent in bigger infants (>1500 g and 31 weeks' gestation: 2.7 [2.5-3.0] vs 3.1 [2.4-3.8]; P = .007, with adjustment for birth weight and gestational age). CONCLUSIONS: Integration of AI into ROP screening programs may lead to improved access to care for secondary prevention of ROP and may facilitate assessment of disease epidemiology and NCU resources.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33637645

Pediatrics	2021	Pediatrics. 2021 Jan;147(1). pii: peds.2020-011833. doi: 10.1542/peds.2020-011833. Epub 2020 Dec 15.	CONTEXT: In the last few decades, data acquisition and processing has seen tremendous amount of growth, thus sparking interest in machine learning (ML) within the health care system. OBJECTIVE: Our aim for this review is to provide an evidence map of the current available evidence on ML in pediatrics and adolescent medicine and provide insight for future research. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted by using Medline, the Cochrane Library, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, Web of Science Library, and EBSCO Dentistry & Oral Science Source. STUDY SELECTION: Articles in which an ML model was assessed for the diagnosis, prediction, or management of any condition in children and adolescents (0-18 years) were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted for year of publication, geographical location, age range, number of participants, disease or condition under investigation, study methodology, reference standard, type, category, and performance of ML algorithms. RESULTS: The review included 363 studies, with subspecialties such as psychiatry, neonatology, and neurology having the most literature. A majority of the studies were from high-income (82%; n = 296) and upper middle-income countries (15%; n = 56), whereas only 3% (n = 11) were from low middle-income countries. Neural networks and ensemble methods were most commonly tested in the 1990s, whereas deep learning and clustering emerged rapidly in the current decade. LIMITATIONS: Only studies conducted in the English language could be used in this review. CONCLUSIONS: The interest in ML has been growing across various subspecialties and countries, suggesting a potential role in health service delivery for children and adolescents in the years to come.		20201215	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33323492
