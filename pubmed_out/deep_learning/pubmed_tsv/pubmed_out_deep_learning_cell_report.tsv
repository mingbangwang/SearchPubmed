Cell Rep	2021	Cell Rep. 2021 Jan 19;34(3):108657. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108657.	It is well known that the development of drug resistance in cancer cells can lead to changes in cell morphology. Here, we describe the use of deep neural networks to analyze this relationship, demonstrating that complex cell morphologies can encode states of signaling networks and unravel cellular mechanisms hidden to conventional approaches. We perform high-content screening of 17 cancer cell lines, generating more than 500 billion data points from approximately 850 million cells. We analyze these data using a deep learning model, resulting in the identification of a continuous 27-dimension space describing all of the observed cell morphologies. From its morphology alone, we could thus predict whether a cell was resistant to ErbB-family drugs, with an accuracy of 74%, and predict the potential mechanism of resistance, subsequently validating the role of MET and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) as drivers of cetuximab resistance in in vitro models of lung and head/neck cancer.	cancer; deep learning; drug resistance; high content screening; imaging; machine learning; morphology	?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472071
Agarwal, Vikram; Shendure, Jay	Predicting mRNA Abundance Directly from Genomic Sequence Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.	Cell Rep	2020	Cell Rep. 2020 May 19;31(7):107663. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107663.	Algorithms that accurately predict gene structure from primary sequence alone were transformative for annotating the human genome. Can we also predict the expression levels of genes based solely on genome sequence? Here, we sought to apply deep convolutional neural networks toward that goal. Surprisingly, a model that includes only promoter sequences and features associated with mRNA stability explains 59% and 71% of variation in steady-state mRNA levels in human and mouse, respectively. This model, termed Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity, and its residuals can be used to quantify the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides strongly predict transcriptional activity. Looking forward, we propose cell-type-specific gene-expression predictions based solely on primary sequences as a grand challenge for the field.	deep learning; gene regulation; predicting gene expression	?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32433972

Cell Rep	2020	Cell Rep. 2020 May 12;31(6):107595. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107595.	To understand the neural basis of behavior, it is important to reveal how movements are planned, executed, and refined by networks of neurons distributed throughout the nervous system. Here, we report the neuroanatomical organization and behavioral roles of cerebellospinal (CeS) neurons. Using intersectional genetic techniques, we find that CeS neurons constitute a small minority of excitatory neurons in the fastigial and interpositus deep cerebellar nuclei, target pre-motor circuits in the ventral spinal cord and the brain, and control distinct aspects of movement. CeS neurons that project to the ipsilateral cervical cord are required for skilled forelimb performance, while CeS neurons that project to the contralateral cervical cord are involved in skilled locomotor learning. Together, this work establishes CeS neurons as a critical component of the neural circuitry for skilled movements and provides insights into the organizational logic of motor networks.	cerebellospinal; cerebellum; deep cerebellar nuclei; descending pathways; fastigial; interpositus; motor control; spinal cord	?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32402292

Cell Rep	2019	Cell Rep. 2019 Dec 10;29(11):3367-3373.e4. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.11.017.	A major challenge in cancer treatment is predicting clinical response to anti-cancer drugs on a personalized basis. Using a pharmacogenomics database of 1,001 cancer cell lines, we trained deep neural networks for prediction of drug response and assessed their performance on multiple clinical cohorts. We demonstrate that deep neural networks outperform the current state in machine learning frameworks. We provide a proof of concept for the use of deep neural network-based frameworks to aid precision oncology strategies.

Cell Rep	2019	Cell Rep. 2019 Jun 18;27(12):3547-3560.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.05.004. Epub 2019 May 23.	Orchestrating cell-cycle-dependent mRNA oscillations is critical to cell proliferation in multicellular organisms. Even though our understanding of cell-cycle-regulated transcription has improved significantly over the last three decades, the mechanisms remain untested in vivo. Unbiased transcriptomic profiling of G0, G1-S, and S-G2-M sorted cells from FUCCI mouse embryos suggested a central role for E2Fs in the control of cell-cycle-dependent gene expression. The analysis of gene expression and E2F-tagged knockin mice with tissue imaging and deep-learning tools suggested that post-transcriptional mechanisms universally coordinate the nuclear accumulation of E2F activators (E2F3A) and canonical (E2F4) and atypical (E2F8) repressors during the cell cycle in vivo. In summary, we mapped the spatiotemporal expression of sentinel E2F activators and canonical and atypical repressors at the single-cell level in vivo and propose that two distinct E2F modules relay the control of gene expression in cells actively cycling (E2F3A-8-4) and exiting the cycle (E2F3A-4) during mammalian development.

Cell Rep	2018	Cell Rep. 2018 Apr 3;23(1):181-193.e7. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.086.	Beyond sample curation and basic pathologic characterization, the digitized H&E-stained images of TCGA samples remain underutilized. To highlight this resource, we present mappings of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) based on H&E images from 13 TCGA tumor types. These TIL maps are derived through computational staining using a convolutional neural network trained to classify patches of images. Affinity propagation revealed local spatial structure in TIL patterns and correlation with overall survival. TIL map structural patterns were grouped using standard histopathological parameters. These patterns are enriched in particular T cell subpopulations derived from molecular measures. TIL densities and spatial structure were differentially enriched among tumor types, immune subtypes, and tumor molecular subtypes, implying that spatial infiltrate state could reflect particular tumor cell aberration states. Obtaining spatial lymphocytic patterns linked to the rich genomic characterization of TCGA samples demonstrates one use for the TCGA image archives with insights into the tumor-immune microenvironment.	artificial intelligence; bioinformatics; computer vision; deep learning; digital pathology; immuno-oncology; lymphocytes; machine learning; tumor microenvironment; tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes	?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29617659

Cell Rep	2017	Cell Rep. 2017 Jan 3;18(1):148-160. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2016.12.012.	Although hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs) were thought to comprise a uniform population, recent evidence supports two distinct sublayers along the radial axis, with deep neurons more likely to form place cells than superficial neurons. CA1 PNs also differ along the transverse axis with regard to direct inputs from entorhinal cortex (EC), with medial EC (MEC) providing spatial information to PNs toward CA2 (proximal CA1) and lateral EC (LEC) providing non-spatial information to PNs toward subiculum (distal CA1). We demonstrate that the two inputs differentially activate the radial sublayers and that this difference reverses along the transverse axis, with MEC preferentially targeting deep PNs in proximal CA1 and LEC preferentially exciting superficial PNs in distal CA1. This differential excitation reflects differences in dendritic spine numbers. Our results reveal a heterogeneity in EC-CA1 connectivity that may help explain differential roles of CA1 PNs in spatial and non-spatial learning and memory.
