Vitsios, Dimitrios; Petrovski, Slave	Mantis-ml: Disease-Agnostic Gene Prioritization from High-Throughput Genomic Screens by Stochastic Semi-supervised Learning.	Am J Hum Genet	2020	Am J Hum Genet. 2020 May 7;106(5):659-678. doi: 10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.03.012.	Access to large-scale genomics datasets has increased the utility of hypothesis-free genome-wide analyses. However, gene signals are often insufficiently powered to reach experiment-wide significance, triggering a process of laborious triaging of genomic-association-study results. We introduce mantis-ml, a multi-dimensional, multi-step machine-learning framework that allows objective assessment of the biological relevance of genes to disease studies. Mantis-ml is an automated machine-learning framework that follows a multi-model approach of stochastic semi-supervised learning to rank disease-associated genes through iterative learning sessions on random balanced datasets across the protein-coding exome. When applied to a range of human diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), epilepsy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), mantis-ml achieved an average area under curve (AUC) prediction performance of 0.81-0.89. Critically, to prove its value as a tool that can be used to interpret exome-wide association studies, we overlapped mantis-ml predictions with data from published cohort-level association studies. We found a statistically significant enrichment of high mantis-ml predictions among the highest-ranked genes from hypothesis-free cohort-level statistics, indicating a substantial improvement over the performance of current state-of-the-art methods and pointing to the capture of true prioritization signals for disease-associated genes. Finally, we introduce a generic mantis-ml score (GMS) trained with over 1,200 features as a generic-disease-likelihood estimator, outperforming published gene-level scores. In addition to our tool, we provide a gene prioritization atlas that includes mantis-ml's predictions across ten disease areas and empowers researchers to interactively navigate through the gene-triaging framework. Mantis-ml is an intuitive tool that supports the objective triaging of large-scale genomic discovery studies and enhances our understanding of complex genotype-phenotype associations.	auto-ML; gene-prioritization; genomics; keras; machine-learning; mantis-ml; positive-unlabeled learning; tensorflow	?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32386536

Am J Hum Genet	2019	Am J Hum Genet. 2019 Apr 4;104(4):749-757. doi: 10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.02.021. Epub 2019 Mar 21.	Over a relatively short period of time, the clinical geneticist's "toolbox" has been expanded by machine-learning algorithms for image analysis, which can be applied to the task of syndrome identification on the basis of facial photographs, but these technologies harbor potential beyond the recognition of established phenotypes. Here, we comprehensively characterized two individuals with a hitherto unknown genetic disorder caused by the same de novo mutation in LEMD2 (c.1436C>T;p.Ser479Phe), the gene which encodes the nuclear envelope protein LEM domain-containing protein 2 (LEMD2). Despite different ages and ethnic backgrounds, both individuals share a progeria-like facial phenotype and a distinct combination of physical and neurologic anomalies, such as growth retardation; hypoplastic jaws crowded with multiple supernumerary, yet unerupted, teeth; and cerebellar intention tremor. Immunofluorescence analyses of patient fibroblasts revealed mutation-induced disturbance of nuclear architecture, recapitulating previously published data in LEMD2-deficient cell lines, and additional experiments suggested mislocalization of mutant LEMD2 protein within the nuclear lamina. Computational analysis of facial features with two different deep neural networks showed phenotypic proximity to other nuclear envelopathies. One of the algorithms, when trained to recognize syndromic similarity (rather than specific syndromes) in an unsupervised approach, clustered both individuals closely together, providing hypothesis-free hints for a common genetic etiology. We show that a recurrent de novo mutation in LEMD2 causes a nuclear envelopathy whose prognosis in adolescence is relatively good in comparison to that of classical Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, and we suggest that the application of artificial intelligence to the analysis of patient images can facilitate the discovery of new genetic disorders.

Park, Eddie; Pan, Zhicheng; Zhang, Zijun; Lin, Lan; Xing, Yi	The Expanding Landscape of Alternative Splicing Variation in Human Populations.	Am J Hum Genet	2018	Am J Hum Genet. 2018 Jan 4;102(1):11-26. doi: 10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.11.002.	Alternative splicing is a tightly regulated biological process by which the number of gene products for any given gene can be greatly expanded. Genomic variants in splicing regulatory sequences can disrupt splicing and cause disease. Recent developments in sequencing technologies and computational biology have allowed researchers to investigate alternative splicing at an unprecedented scale and resolution. Population-scale transcriptome studies have revealed many naturally occurring genetic variants that modulate alternative splicing and consequently influence phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility in human populations. Innovations in experimental and computational tools such as massively parallel reporter assays and deep learning have enabled the rapid screening of genomic variants for their causal impacts on splicing. In this review, we describe technological advances that have greatly increased the speed and scale at which discoveries are made about the genetic variation of alternative splicing. We summarize major findings from population transcriptomic studies of alternative splicing and discuss the implications of these findings for human genetics and medicine.		?	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29304370
