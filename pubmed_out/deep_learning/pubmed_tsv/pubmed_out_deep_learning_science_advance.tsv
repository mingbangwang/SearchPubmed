Sci Adv	2021	Sci Adv. 2021 Feb 17;7(8). pii: 7/8/eabe2480. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.abe2480. Print 2021 Feb.	Crown-like structures (CLSs) are adipose microenvironments of macrophages engulfing adipocytes. Their histological density in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) predicts metabolic disorder progression in obesity and is believed to initiate obesity comorbidities. Here, we use three-dimensional (3D) light sheet microscopy and deep learning to quantify 3D features of VAT CLSs in lean and obese states. Obese CLS densities are significantly higher, composing 3.9% of tissue volume compared with 0.46% in lean tissue. Across the states, individual CLS structural characteristics span similar ranges; however, subpopulations are distinguishable. Obese VAT contains large CLSs absent from lean tissues, located near the tissue center, while lean CLSs have higher volumetric cell densities and prolate shapes. These features are consistent with inefficient adipocyte elimination in obesity that contributes to chronic inflammation, representing histological biomarkers to assess adipose pathogenesis. This tissue processing, imaging, and analysis pipeline can be applied to quantitatively classify 3D microenvironments across diverse tissues.		20210217	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33597245

Sci Adv	2021	Sci Adv. 2021 Jan 15;7(3). pii: 7/3/eabe0431. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.abe0431. Print 2021 Jan.	Traditional imaging cytometry uses fluorescence markers to identify specific structures but is limited in throughput by the labeling process. We develop a label-free technique that alleviates the physical staining and provides multiplexed readouts via a deep learning-augmented digital labeling method. We leverage the rich structural information and superior sensitivity in reflectance microscopy and show that digital labeling predicts accurate subcellular features after training on immunofluorescence images. We demonstrate up to three times improvement in the prediction accuracy over the state of the art. Beyond fluorescence prediction, we demonstrate that single cell-level structural phenotypes of cell cycles are correctly reproduced by the digital multiplexed images, including Golgi twins, Golgi haze during mitosis, and DNA synthesis. We further show that the multiplexed readouts enable accurate multiparametric single-cell profiling across a large cell population. Our method can markedly improve the throughput for imaging cytometry toward applications for phenotyping, pathology, and high-content screening.		20210115	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33523908

Sci Adv	2021	Sci Adv. 2021 Jan 1;7(1). pii: 7/1/eabd6127. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.abd6127. Print 2021 Jan.	Number sense, the ability to estimate numerosity, is observed in naive animals, but how this cognitive function emerges in the brain remains unclear. Here, using an artificial deep neural network that models the ventral visual stream of the brain, we show that number-selective neurons can arise spontaneously, even in the complete absence of learning. We also show that the responses of these neurons can induce the abstract number sense, the ability to discriminate numerosity independent of low-level visual cues. We found number tuning in a randomly initialized network originating from a combination of monotonically decreasing and increasing neuronal activities, which emerges spontaneously from the statistical properties of bottom-up projections. We confirmed that the responses of these number-selective neurons show the single- and multineuron characteristics observed in the brain and enable the network to perform number comparison tasks. These findings provide insight into the origin of innate cognitive functions.		20210101	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33523851

Characterizing genome-wide binding profiles of transcription factors (TFs) is essential for understanding biological processes. Although techniques have been developed to assess binding profiles within a population of cells, determining them at a single-cell level remains elusive. Here, we report scFAN (single-cell factor analysis network), a deep learning model that predicts genome-wide TF binding profiles in individual cells. scFAN is pretrained on genome-wide bulk assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), DNA sequence, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data and uses single-cell ATAC-seq to predict TF binding in individual cells. We demonstrate the efficacy of scFAN by both studying sequence motifs enriched within predicted binding peaks and using predicted TFs for discovering cell types. We develop a new metric "TF activity score" to characterize each cell and show that activity scores can reliably capture cell identities. scFAN allows us to discover and study cellular identities and heterogeneity based on chromatin accessibility profiles.		20201218	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33355120

Sci Adv	2020	Sci Adv. 2020 Oct 21;6(43). pii: 6/43/eabc6216. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.abc6216. Print 2020 Oct.	The chemical design of polymers with target structural and/or functional properties represents a grand challenge in materials science. While data-driven design approaches are promising, success with polymers has been limited, largely due to limitations in data availability. Here, we demonstrate the targeted sequence design of single-chain structure in polymers by combining coarse-grained modeling, machine learning, and model optimization. Nearly 2000 unique coarse-grained polymers are simulated to construct and analyze machine learning models. We find that deep neural networks inexpensively and reliably predict structural properties with limited sequence information as input. By coupling trained ML models with sequential model-based optimization, polymer sequences are proposed to exhibit globular, swollen, or rod-like behaviors, which are verified by explicit simulations. This work highlights the promising integration of coarse-grained modeling with data-driven design and represents a necessary and crucial step toward more complex polymer design efforts.		20201021	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33087352

Understanding spin textures in magnetic systems is extremely important to the spintronics and it is vital to extrapolate the magnetic Hamiltonian parameters through the experimentally determined spin. It can provide a better complementary link between theories and experimental results. We demonstrate deep learning can quantify the magnetic Hamiltonian from magnetic domain images. To train the deep neural network, we generated domain configurations with Monte Carlo method. The errors from the estimations was analyzed with statistical methods and confirmed the network was successfully trained to relate the Hamiltonian parameters with magnetic structure characteristics. The network was applied to estimate experimentally observed domain images. The results are consistent with the reported results, which verifies the effectiveness of our methods. On the basis of our study, we anticipate that the deep learning techniques make a bridge to connect the experimental and theoretical approaches not only in magnetism but also throughout any scientific research.		20200925	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32978161
Barth, R; Bystricky, K; Shaban, H A	Coupling chromatin structure and dynamics by live super-resolution imaging.

Chromatin conformation regulates gene expression and thus, constant remodeling of chromatin structure is essential to guarantee proper cell function. To gain insight into the spatiotemporal organization of the genome, we use high-density photoactivated localization microscopy and deep learning to obtain temporally resolved super-resolution images of chromatin in living cells. In combination with high-resolution dense motion reconstruction, we find elongated ~45- to 90-nm-wide chromatin "blobs." A computational chromatin model suggests that these blobs are dynamically associating chromatin fragments in close physical and genomic proximity and adopt topologically associated domain-like interactions in the time-average limit. Experimentally, we found that chromatin exhibits a spatiotemporal correlation over ~4 mum in space and tens of seconds in time, while chromatin dynamics are correlated over ~6 mum and last 40 s. Notably, chromatin structure and dynamics are closely related, which may constitute a mechanism to grant access to regions with high local chromatin concentration.		20200701	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32937447
He, Yu; Jang, Hyo Sik; Xing, Xiaoyun; Li, Daofeng; Vasek, Michael J; Dougherty, Joseph D; Wang, Ting	DeepH&M: Estimating single-CpG hydroxymethylation and methylation levels from enrichment and restriction enzyme sequencing methods.	Sci Adv	2020	Sci Adv. 2020 Jul 1;6(27). pii: 6/27/eaba0521. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aba0521. Print 2020 Jul.	Increased appreciation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) as a stable epigenetic mark, which defines cell identity and disease progress, has engendered a need for cost-effective, but high-resolution, 5hmC mapping technology. Current enrichment-based technologies provide cheap but low-resolution and relative enrichment of 5hmC levels, while single-base resolution methods can be prohibitively expensive to scale up to large experiments. To address this problem, we developed a deep learning-based method, "DeepH&M," which integrates enrichment and restriction enzyme sequencing methods to simultaneously estimate absolute hydroxymethylation and methylation levels at single-CpG resolution. Using 7-week-old mouse cerebellum data for training the DeepH&M model, we demonstrated that the 5hmC and 5mC levels predicted by DeepH&M were in high concordance with whole-genome bisulfite-based approaches. The DeepH&M model can be applied to 7-week-old frontal cortex and 79-week-old cerebellum, revealing the robust generalizability of this method to other tissues from various biological time points.		20200701	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32937429

Sci Adv	2020	Sci Adv. 2020 Jul 22;6(30):eaba2619. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aba2619. eCollection 2020 Jul.	We present Scaden, a deep neural network for cell deconvolution that uses gene expression information to infer the cellular composition of tissues. Scaden is trained on single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to engineer discriminative features that confer robustness to bias and noise, making complex data preprocessing and feature selection unnecessary. We demonstrate that Scaden outperforms existing deconvolution algorithms in both precision and robustness. A single trained network reliably deconvolves bulk RNA-seq and microarray, human and mouse tissue expression data and leverages the combined information of multiple datasets. Because of this stability and flexibility, we surmise that deep learning will become an algorithmic mainstay for cell deconvolution of various data types. Scaden's software package and web application are easy to use on new as well as diverse existing expression datasets available in public resources, deepening the molecular and cellular understanding of developmental and disease processes.		20200722	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32832661

Sci Adv	2020	Sci Adv. 2020 Jul 15;6(29):eaba1482. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aba1482. eCollection 2020 Jul.	Forecasting fields of oceanic phenomena has long been dependent on physical equation-based numerical models. The challenge is that many natural processes need to be considered for understanding complicated phenomena. In contrast, rules of the processes are already embedded in the time-series observation itself. Thus, inspired by largely available satellite remote sensing data and the advance of deep learning technology, we developed a purely satellite data-driven deep learning model for forecasting the sea surface temperature evolution associated with a typical phenomenon: a tropical instability wave. During the testing period of 9 years (2010-2019), our model accurately and efficiently forecasts the sea surface temperature field. This study demonstrates the strong potential of the satellite data-driven deep learning model as an alternative to traditional numerical models for forecasting oceanic phenomena.		20200715	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32832620
Charpentier, M J E; Harte, M; Poirotte, C; de Bellefon, J Meric; Laubi, B; Kappeler, P M; Renoult, J P	Same father, same face: Deep learning reveals selection for signaling kinship in a wild primate.	Sci Adv	2020	Sci Adv. 2020 May 27;6(22):eaba3274. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aba3274. eCollection 2020 May.	Many animals rely on facial traits to recognize their kin; however, whether these traits have been selected specifically for this function remains unknown. Using deep learning for face recognition, we present the first evidence that interindividual facial resemblance has been selected to signal paternal kinship. Mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) live in matrilineal societies, in which females spend their entire lives not only with maternal half-sisters (MHS) but also with paternal half-sisters (PHS). We show that PHS have more differentiated social relationships compared to nonkin, suggesting the existence of kin recognition mechanisms. We further demonstrate that facial resemblance increases with genetic relatedness. However, PHS resemble each other visually more than MHS do, despite both kin categories sharing similar degrees of genetic relatedness. This paternally derived facial resemblance among PHS indicates selection to facilitate kin recognition. This study also highlights the potential of artificial intelligence to study phenotypic evolution.		20200527	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32537486
Du, Ming; Nashed, Youssef S G; Kandel, Saugat; Gursoy, Doga; Jacobsen, Chris	Three dimensions, two microscopes, one code: Automatic differentiation for x-ray nanotomography beyond the depth of focus limit.	Sci Adv	2020	Sci Adv. 2020 Mar 27;6(13):eaay3700. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aay3700. eCollection 2020 Mar.	Conventional tomographic reconstruction algorithms assume that one has obtained pure projection images, involving no within-specimen diffraction effects nor multiple scattering. Advances in x-ray nanotomography are leading toward the violation of these assumptions, by combining the high penetration power of x-rays, which enables thick specimens to be imaged, with improved spatial resolution that decreases the depth of focus of the imaging system. We describe a reconstruction method where multiple scattering and diffraction effects in thick samples are modeled by multislice propagation and the 3D object function is retrieved through iterative optimization. We show that the same proposed method works for both full-field microscopy and for coherent scanning techniques like ptychography. Our implementation uses the optimization toolbox and the automatic differentiation capability of the open-source deep learning package TensorFlow, demonstrating a straightforward way to solve optimization problems in computational imaging with flexibility and portability.		20200327	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32258397

Sci Adv	2020	Sci Adv. 2020 Feb 26;6(9):eaaw2140. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aaw2140. eCollection 2020 Feb.	Traditionally, statistical procedures have been derived via analytic calculations whose validity often relies on sample size growing to infinity. We use tools from deep learning to develop a new approach, adversarial Monte Carlo meta-learning, for constructing optimal statistical procedures. Statistical problems are framed as two-player games in which Nature adversarially selects a distribution that makes it difficult for a statistician to answer the scientific question using data drawn from this distribution. The players' strategies are parameterized via neural networks, and optimal play is learned by modifying the network weights over many repetitions of the game. Given sufficient computing time, the statistician's strategy is (nearly) optimal at the finite observed sample size, rather than in the hypothetical scenario where sample size grows to infinity. In numerical experiments and data examples, this approach performs favorably compared to standard practice in point estimation, individual-level predictions, and interval estimation.		20200226	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32166115

Sci Adv	2020	Sci Adv. 2020 Feb 26;6(9):eaay6913. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aay6913. eCollection 2020 Feb.	Atomic force microscopy (AFM) with molecule-functionalized tips has emerged as the primary experimental technique for probing the atomic structure of organic molecules on surfaces. Most experiments have been limited to nearly planar aromatic molecules due to difficulties with interpretation of highly distorted AFM images originating from nonplanar molecules. Here, we develop a deep learning infrastructure that matches a set of AFM images with a unique descriptor characterizing the molecular configuration, allowing us to predict the molecular structure directly. We apply this methodology to resolve several distinct adsorption configurations of 1S-camphor on Cu(111) based on low-temperature AFM measurements. This approach will open the door to applying high-resolution AFM to a large variety of systems, for which routine atomic and chemical structural resolution on the level of individual objects/molecules would be a major breakthrough.		20200226	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32133405

While machine learning has been making enormous strides in many technical areas, it is still massively underused in transmission electron microscopy. To address this, a convolutional neural network model was developed for reliable classification of crystal structures from small numbers of electron images and diffraction patterns with no preferred orientation. Diffraction data containing 571,340 individual crystals divided among seven families, 32 genera, and 230 space groups were used to train the network. Despite the highly imbalanced dataset, the network narrows down the space groups to the top two with over 70% confidence in the worst case and up to 95% in the common cases. As examples, we benchmarked against alloys to two-dimensional materials to cross-validate our deep-learning model against high-resolution transmission electron images and diffraction patterns. We present this result both as a research tool and deep-learning application for diffraction analysis.		20191030	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31976364

When tested against independently generated datasets (our own and those published by other groups), DeepSpCas9 showed high generalization performance.

Sci Adv	2019	Sci Adv. 2019 Oct 2;5(10):eaaw6548. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aaw6548. eCollection 2019 Oct.	Measurements of the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) solar spectral irradiance (SSI) are essential for understanding drivers of space weather effects, such as radio blackouts, and aerodynamic drag on satellites during periods of enhanced solar activity. In this paper, we show how to learn a mapping from EUV narrowband images to spectral irradiance measurements using data from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory obtained between 2010 to 2014. We describe a protocol and baselines for measuring the performance of models. Our best performing machine learning (ML) model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperforms other ML models, and a differential emission measure (DEM) based approach, yielding average relative errors of under 4.6% (maximum error over emission lines) and more typically 1.6% (median). We also provide evidence that the proposed method is solving this mapping in a way that makes physical sense and by paying attention to magnetic structures known to drive EUV SSI variability.		20191002	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31616783

Sci Adv	2019	Sci Adv. 2019 Sep 27;5(9):eaaw8989. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aaw8989. eCollection 2019 Sep.	The presence and configurations of defects are primary components determining materials functionality. Their population and distribution are often nonergodic and dependent on synthesis history, and therefore rarely amenable to direct theoretical prediction. Here, dynamic electron beam-induced transformations in Si deposited on a graphene monolayer are used to create libraries of possible Si and carbon vacancy defects. Deep learning networks are developed for automated image analysis and recognition of the defects, creating a library of (meta) stable defect configurations. Density functional theory is used to estimate atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) signatures of the classified defects from the created library, allowing identification of several defect types across imaging platforms. This approach allows automatic creation of defect libraries in solids, exploring the metastable configurations always present in real materials, and correlative studies with other atomically resolved techniques, providing comprehensive insight into defect functionalities.		20190927	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31598551

Sci Adv	2019	Sci Adv. 2019 Sep 4;5(9):eaaw0736. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aaw0736. eCollection 2019 Sep.	Video recording is now ubiquitous in the study of animal behavior, but its analysis on a large scale is prohibited by the time and resources needed to manually process large volumes of data. We present a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach that provides a fully automated pipeline for face detection, tracking, and recognition of wild chimpanzees from long-term video records. In a 14-year dataset yielding 10 million face images from 23 individuals over 50 hours of footage, we obtained an overall accuracy of 92.5% for identity recognition and 96.2% for sex recognition. Using the identified faces, we generated co-occurrence matrices to trace changes in the social network structure of an aging population. The tools we developed enable easy processing and annotation of video datasets, including those from other species. Such automated analysis unveils the future potential of large-scale longitudinal video archives to address fundamental questions in behavior and conservation.		20190904	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31517043

Sci Adv	2019	Sci Adv. 2019 Aug 14;5(8):eaaw4967. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aaw4967. eCollection 2019 Aug.	Traditional anatomical analyses captured only a fraction of real phenomic information. Here, we apply deep learning to quantify total phenotypic similarity across 2468 butterfly photographs, covering 38 subspecies from the polymorphic mimicry complex of Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene. Euclidean phenotypic distances, calculated using a deep convolutional triplet network, demonstrate significant convergence between interspecies co-mimics. This quantitatively validates a key prediction of Mullerian mimicry theory, evolutionary biology's oldest mathematical model. Phenotypic neighbor-joining trees are significantly correlated with wing pattern gene phylogenies, demonstrating objective, phylogenetically informative phenome capture. Comparative analyses indicate frequency-dependent mutual convergence with coevolutionary exchange of wing pattern features. Therefore, phenotypic analysis supports reciprocal coevolution, predicted by classical mimicry theory but since disputed, and reveals mutual convergence as an intrinsic generator for the unexpected diversity of Mullerian mimicry. This demonstrates that deep learning can generate phenomic spatial embeddings, which enable quantitative tests of evolutionary hypotheses previously only testable subjectively.		20190814	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31453326
Popova, Mariya; Isayev, Olexandr; Tropsha, Alexander	Deep reinforcement learning for de novo drug design.	Sci Adv	2018	Sci Adv. 2018 Jul 25;4(7):eaap7885. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aap7885. eCollection 2018 Jul.	We have devised and implemented a novel computational strategy for de novo design of molecules with desired properties termed ReLeaSE (Reinforcement Learning for Structural Evolution). On the basis of deep and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, ReLeaSE integrates two deep neural networks-generative and predictive-that are trained separately but are used jointly to generate novel targeted chemical libraries. ReLeaSE uses simple representation of molecules by their simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings only. Generative models are trained with a stack-augmented memory network to produce chemically feasible SMILES strings, and predictive models are derived to forecast the desired properties of the de novo-generated compounds. In the first phase of the method, generative and predictive models are trained separately with a supervised learning algorithm. In the second phase, both models are trained jointly with the RL approach to bias the generation of new chemical structures toward those with the desired physical and/or biological properties. In the proof-of-concept study, we have used the ReLeaSE method to design chemical libraries with a bias toward structural complexity or toward compounds with maximal, minimal, or specific range of physical properties, such as melting point or hydrophobicity, or toward compounds with inhibitory activity against Janus protein kinase 2. The approach proposed herein can find a general use for generating targeted chemical libraries of novel compounds optimized for either a single desired property or multiple properties.		20180725	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30050984
Sala, Enric; Mayorga, Juan; Costello, Christopher; Kroodsma, David; Palomares, Maria L D; Pauly, Daniel; Sumaila, U Rashid; Zeller, Dirk	The economics of fishing the high seas.	Sci Adv	2018	Sci Adv. 2018 Jun 6;4(6):eaat2504. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aat2504. eCollection 2018 Jun.	While the ecological impacts of fishing the waters beyond national jurisdiction (the "high seas") have been widely studied, the economic rationale is more difficult to ascertain because of scarce data on the costs and revenues of the fleets that fish there. Newly compiled satellite data and machine learning now allow us to track individual fishing vessels on the high seas in near real time. These technological advances help us quantify high-seas fishing effort, costs, and benefits, and assess whether, where, and when high-seas fishing makes economic sense. We characterize the global high-seas fishing fleet and report the economic benefits of fishing the high seas globally, nationally, and at the scale of individual fleets. Our results suggest that fishing at the current scale is enabled by large government subsidies, without which as much as 54% of the present high-seas fishing grounds would be unprofitable at current fishing rates. The patterns of fishing profitability vary widely between countries, types of fishing, and distance to port. Deep-sea bottom trawling often produces net economic benefits only thanks to subsidies, and much fishing by the world's largest fishing fleets would largely be unprofitable without subsidies and low labor costs. These results support recent calls for subsidy and fishery management reforms on the high seas.		20180606	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29881780

Sci Adv	2017	Sci Adv. 2017 Aug 4;3(8):e1700606. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.1700606. eCollection 2017 Aug.	Establishing early warning systems for anthrax attacks is crucial in biodefense. Despite numerous studies for decades, the limited sensitivity of conventional biochemical methods essentially requires preprocessing steps and thus has limitations to be used in realistic settings of biological warfare. We present an optical method for rapid and label-free screening of Bacillus anthracis spores through the synergistic application of holographic microscopy and deep learning. A deep convolutional neural network is designed to classify holographic images of unlabeled living cells. After training, the network outperforms previous techniques in all accuracy measures, achieving single-spore sensitivity and subgenus specificity. The unique "representation learning" capability of deep learning enables direct training from raw images instead of manually extracted features. The method automatically recognizes key biological traits encoded in the images and exploits them as fingerprints. This remarkable learning ability makes the proposed method readily applicable to classifying various single cells in addition to B. anthracis, as demonstrated for the diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes, without any modification. We believe that our strategy will make holographic microscopy more accessible to medical doctors and biomedical scientists for easy, rapid, and accurate point-of-care diagnosis of pathogens.		20170804	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28798957
