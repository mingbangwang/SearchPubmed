Lancet	2020	Lancet. 2020 Feb 1;395(10221):350-360. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32998-8.	BACKGROUND: Improved markers of prognosis are needed to stratify patients with early-stage colorectal cancer to refine selection of adjuvant therapy. The aim of the present study was to develop a biomarker of patient outcome after primary colorectal cancer resection by directly analysing scanned conventional haematoxylin and eosin stained sections using deep learning. METHODS: More than 12 000 000 image tiles from patients with a distinctly good or poor disease outcome from four cohorts were used to train a total of ten convolutional neural networks, purpose-built for classifying supersized heterogeneous images. A prognostic biomarker integrating the ten networks was determined using patients with a non-distinct outcome. The marker was tested on 920 patients with slides prepared in the UK, and then independently validated according to a predefined protocol in 1122 patients treated with single-agent capecitabine using slides prepared in Norway. All cohorts included only patients with resectable tumours, and a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour tissue block available for analysis. The primary outcome was cancer-specific survival. FINDINGS: 828 patients from four cohorts had a distinct outcome and were used as a training cohort to obtain clear ground truth. 1645 patients had a non-distinct outcome and were used for tuning. The biomarker provided a hazard ratio for poor versus good prognosis of 3.84 (95% CI 2.72-5.43; p<0.0001) in the primary analysis of the validation cohort, and 3.04 (2.07-4.47; p<0.0001) after adjusting for established prognostic markers significant in univariable analyses of the same cohort, which were pN stage, pT stage, lymphatic invasion, and venous vascular invasion. INTERPRETATION: A clinically useful prognostic marker was developed using deep learning allied to digital scanning of conventional haematoxylin and eosin stained tumour tissue sections. The assay has been extensively evaluated in large, independent patient populations, correlates with and outperforms established molecular and morphological prognostic markers, and gives consistent results across tumour and nodal stage. The biomarker stratified stage II and III patients into sufficiently distinct prognostic groups that potentially could be used to guide selection of adjuvant treatment by avoiding therapy in very low risk groups and identifying patients who would benefit from more intensive treatment regimes.

Lancet	2018	Lancet. 2018 Dec 1;392(10162):2388-2396. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31645-3. Epub 2018 Oct 11.	BACKGROUND: Non-contrast head CT scan is the current standard for initial imaging of patients with head trauma or stroke symptoms. We aimed to develop and validate a set of deep learning algorithms for automated detection of the following key findings from these scans: intracranial haemorrhage and its types (ie, intraparenchymal, intraventricular, subdural, extradural, and subarachnoid); calvarial fractures; midline shift; and mass effect. METHODS: We retrospectively collected a dataset containing 313 318 head CT scans together with their clinical reports from around 20 centres in India between Jan 1, 2011, and June 1, 2017. A randomly selected part of this dataset (Qure25k dataset) was used for validation and the rest was used to develop algorithms. An additional validation dataset (CQ500 dataset) was collected in two batches from centres that were different from those used for the development and Qure25k datasets. We excluded postoperative scans and scans of patients younger than 7 years. The original clinical radiology report and consensus of three independent radiologists were considered as gold standard for the Qure25k and CQ500 datasets, respectively. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were primarily used to assess the algorithms. FINDINGS: The Qure25k dataset contained 21 095 scans (mean age 43 years; 9030 [43%] female patients), and the CQ500 dataset consisted of 214 scans in the first batch (mean age 43 years; 94 [44%] female patients) and 277 scans in the second batch (mean age 52 years; 84 [30%] female patients). On the Qure25k dataset, the algorithms achieved an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.91-0.93) for detecting intracranial haemorrhage (0.90 [0.89-0.91] for intraparenchymal, 0.96 [0.94-0.97] for intraventricular, 0.92 [0.90-0.93] for subdural, 0.93 [0.91-0.95] for extradural, and 0.90 [0.89-0.92] for subarachnoid). On the CQ500 dataset, AUC was 0.94 (0.92-0.97) for intracranial haemorrhage (0.95 [0.93-0.98], 0.93 [0.87-1.00], 0.95 [0.91-0.99], 0.97 [0.91-1.00], and 0.96 [0.92-0.99], respectively). AUCs on the Qure25k dataset were 0.92 (0.91-0.94) for calvarial fractures, 0.93 (0.91-0.94) for midline shift, and 0.86 (0.85-0.87) for mass effect, while AUCs on the CQ500 dataset were 0.96 (0.92-1.00), 0.97 (0.94-1.00), and 0.92 (0.89-0.95), respectively. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that deep learning algorithms can accurately identify head CT scan abnormalities requiring urgent attention, opening up the possibility to use these algorithms to automate the triage process.

Lancet	2011	Lancet. 2011 Oct 15;378(9800):1379-87. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61144-6.	BACKGROUND: For some surgical procedures to be done, a patient's blood circulation needs to be stopped. In such situations, the maintenance of blood flow to the brain is perceived beneficial even in the presence of deep hypothermia. We aimed to assess the benefits of the maintenance of antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) compared with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). METHODS: Patients aged 18-80 years undergoing pulmonary endarterectomy surgery in a UK centre (Papworth Hospital, Cambridge) were randomly assigned with a computer generated sequence to receive either DHCA for periods of up to 20 min at 20 degrees C or ACP (1:1 ratio). The primary endpoint was change in cognitive function at 12 weeks after surgery, as assessed by the trail-making A and B tests, the Rey auditory verbal learning test, and the grooved pegboard test. Patients and assessors were masked to treatment allocation. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN84972261. FINDINGS: We enrolled 74 of 196 screened patients (35 to receive DHCA and 39 to receive ACP). Nine patients crossed over from ACP to DHCA to allow complete endarterectomy. At 12 weeks, the mean difference between the two groups in Z scores (the change in cognitive function score from baseline divided by the baseline SD) for the three main cognitive tests was 0.14 (95% CI -0.14 to 0.42; p=0.33) for the trail-making A and B tests, -0.06 (-0.38 to 0.25; p=0.69) for the Rey auditory verbal learning test, and 0.01 (-0.26 to 0.29; p=0.92) for the grooved pegboard test. All patients showed improvement in cognitive function at 12 weeks. We recorded no significant difference in adverse events between the two groups. At 12 weeks, two patients had died (one in each group) [corrected]. INTERPRETATION: Cognitive function is not impaired by either ACP or DHCA. We recommend circulatory arrest as the optimum modality for patients undergoing pulmonary endarterectomy surgery.
